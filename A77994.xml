         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the midſt of theſe, his ſtudy was to finde out a more ſublime way, and hidden art of ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, then was in the power of all things to contribute or teach: Such a skill as did not onely poyſe and compoſe his ſpirit in the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all; but might fortifie and furniſh him with proviſion for the future againſt the loſs of all, in times wherein <hi>no man knoweth what

               <p>Our <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> experimentally holds forth in this Goſpel-Text, the very life and ſoul of all practical Divinity; wherein we may plainly read his own proficiency in Chriſts School; and what leſſon every Chriſtian that would evidence the power and growth of godlineſſe in his own ſoul, muſt neceſſarily learn from him.</p>

of ſatisfaction in my own heart, through the grace of Chriſt that is in me; though I have not outward comforts and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodations to ſupply my neceſſities, yet I enjoy portion enough betwixt Chriſt and my own ſoul abundantly to ſatisfie me in every condition. And this interpretation is ſutable to that place <hi>Pro. 14 14. A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf;</hi> and agreeable to what he verifies of himſelf in another place; that <hi>though he had nothing yet he poſſeſſed all things;</hi> becauſe he had right to the covenant and promiſe, which virtually containes all, and an intereſt in Chriſt the fountain and good of all, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, no marvell he ſaith that in whatſoever ſtate he was in, he was content. Thus you have the genuine interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the text. I ſhall not make any diviſion of the words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I take them only to proſecute that <hi>one duty</hi> moſt neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> The quieting and comforting the hearts of Gods people under the troubles and changes they meet withall, in theſe heart-ſhaking times.

               <p>Doct. <hi>That to be well skilled in the myſtery of Chriſtian Contentment is the Duty, Glory, and Excellency of a Chriſtian.</hi>

               <p>This Evangelical truth is held forth ſufficiently in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet take one or two paralel places more for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. &amp; 8. you have both the duty expreſt, and the glory thereof: <hi>Having food and raiment</hi> (ſaith he verſ. 8.) <hi>let us be therewith content,</hi> there is the duty; <hi>But godlineſs with contentment is great gain,</hi> verſ. 6. there is the glory and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it: as if godlineſſe were not gain except there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment withall.

               <p>Concerning the firſt, take this deſcription; <hi>Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is that ſweet, inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods wiſe, and fatherly diſpoſe in every condition.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>ntment, very comfortable and uſeful for troubled hearts, in troubled times and conditions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Contentment</hi> (I ſay) <hi>is a ſweet [inward] heart-thing, it is a work of the ſpirit within doors:</hi> It is not only a not-ſeeking help to our ſelves by outward violence, or a forbearance of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed murmurring expreſſions, in froward words and carriages againſt God or others; but it is the inward ſubmiſſion of the heart. <hi>Pſal. 62. 1. Truly, my ſoul waiteth upon God; and ver. 5. My ſoul wait thou only upon God,</hi> ſo it is in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ooks; but the words may be tranſlated as rightly, <hi>My ſoul be thou ſilent unto God; Hold thy peace O my ſoul:</hi> Not only the tongue muſt hold its peace, but the ſoul muſt be ſilent: Many may ſit down ſilently, forbearing diſcontented expreſſions, yet are inwardly ſwollen with diſcontentment; now this manifeſteth a perplexed diſtemper and a great frowardneſſe in their hearts: And God notwithſtanding their outward ſilence hears the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fretting language of their ſouls. The ſhoe may be ſmooth and neat without, whilſt the fleſh is pinched within: There may be much calmneſſe and ſtilneſſe outwardly, and yet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful confuſion, bitterneſſe; diſturbance and vexation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Some are ſo weak that they are not able to contain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe of their own ſpirits, but in words and behaviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what woful perturbations there are within, their ſpirits being like the raging Sea caſting forth nothing but mire and dirt, being not only troubleſome to themſelves but to all thoſe they live with: Others there are who are able to keep in ſuch diſtempers of heart, (as <hi>Judas</hi> did when he betrayed Chriſt with a kiſſe,) but ſtill they boyl inwardly and eate like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning ſome whoſe words are ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then honey, and butter, and yet have war in their hearts; and as he ſaith in another place, whilſt <hi>I kept ſilence my bones waxed old;</hi> ſo theſe, whilſt there is a ſerene calme upon their tongues, have yet bluſtring ſtorms in their ſpirits, and whilſt they keep ſilence their hearts are troubled, and even worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with anguiſh and vexation; they have peace and quiet outwardly, but war from the unruly and turbulent workings of their hearts, that is within. If the attainment to true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment were as eaſy as keeping quiet outwardly, there need be no great learning of it; it might be had with leſſe skill and ſtrength than an Apoſtle had; yea than an ordinary chriſtian hath or may have. Therefore certainly there is a great deal more in it than can be attained by common gifts, and ordinary power of reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which often bridles in nature. It is a heart buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>It is the [quiet] of the heart;</hi> All is ſedate and ſtill there, and to underſtand this the better; This quiet gracious frame of ſpirit, it is not oppoſed.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>To a due ſenſe of affiiction.</hi> God doth give leave to his people to be ſenſible of what they ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As it is in the body natural, if the body takes phyſick, and is not able to bear it but preſently vomits it up, or if it be not at all ſenſible, if it ſtir not the body; either of theſe waies the phyſick doth no good, but argues the body much diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and will hardly be cured. So it is with the ſpirits of men under afflictions; if either they cannot bear Gods potions but caſt them up again, or are not ſenſible of them, and their ſouls are no more ſtirr'd by them then the body is by a draught of ſmal beer, it is a ſad ſymptome that their ſouls are in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and almoſt incurable condition. So that this inward quietneſſe is not in oppoſition to the ſenſe of affliction; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were no true contentment if you were not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſenſible of your af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe communicate his ſad condition to his gracious friends, ſhewing them how God hath dealt with him and how heavy the affliction is upon him, that they may ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to his wearied ſoul. It is not oppoſed.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>To all lawful ſeeking out for help in another condition, or ſimply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be delivered out of the preſent affliction by the uſe of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means.</hi> No, I may lay in proviſion for my deliverance, and uſe Gods means, waiting on him becauſe I know not but that it may be his will to alter my condition, and ſo far as he leads me I may follow his providence, it is but my duty. God is thus far mercifully indulgent to our weakneſſe, and he will not take it ill at our hands if by earneſt and importunat prayer we ſeek unto him for deliverance, till we know his good pleaſure therein. And certainly thus ſeeking for help with ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and holy reſignation of ſpirit, to be delivered when God will, and as God will, and how God will, ſo that our wils are melted into the will of God, this is no oppoſition to the quietneſſe which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>

               <p>Anſ. <hi>To murmuring and repining at the hand of God; as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Iſraelits often did,</hi> which if we our ſelves cannot indure either in our children or ſervants, much leſſe can God bear it in us.</p>

               <p>3 <hi>To tumultuouſneſs of ſpirit:</hi> When the thoughts run diſtractingly and work in a confuſed manner, ſo that the affections are like the unruly multitude in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who knew not for what end they were come together. The Lord expects that you ſhould be ſilent under his rod, and as he ſaid in <hi>Act. 19. 36. You

ought to be quiet and to do nothing raſhly.</hi>

It is an expreſſion of <hi>Luthers,</hi> ordinary works that are done in faith, and from faith, are more precious than heaven and earth. And if this be ſo, and a Chriſtian know it, it is not a little matter that ſhould divert him; but he ſhould anſwer every avocation, and reſiſt every tentation, as <hi>Nebemiah</hi> did <hi>Chap. 6. 3. Sanballat, Geſhem, and Tobiah</hi> (when they would have hindred the building of the wal) with this, <hi>I am doing a great work</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo that I cannot come down, why ſhould the work of the Lord ceaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 <hi>To diſtracting, heart-eating cares and fears.</hi> A gracious heart ſo eſtimats its union with Chriſt and the work that God ſets it about, as it will not willingly ſuffer any thing to come in to choak it, or dead it. A Chriſtian is deſirous that the word of God ſhould take ſuch full poſſeſſion as to divide between ſoul and ſpirit, but he would not ſuffer the fear and noiſe of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings to take ſuch impreſſion in his ſoul, as to make a diviſion and ſtrugling there, like the twins in <hi>Rebeckaes</hi> womb. A great man will permit common people to ſtand without his doors, but he will not let them come in &amp; make a noiſe in his cloſet or bedchamber when he purpoſely retires himſelf from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployments. So a well tempered ſpirit though it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after things abroad without doors in the world, and ſuffer ſome ordinary cares and fears to break in to the ſuburbs of the ſoul, ſo as to have a light touch upon the thoughts: Yet it will not upon any terms admit of an intruſion into the privy-chamber, which ſhould be wholly reſerved for Jeſus Chriſt as his inward Temple.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>To ſinking diſcouragements.</hi> When things fall not out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to expectation, when the tyde of ſecond cauſes runs ſo low that we ſee little left in outward means to bear up our hopes and hearts. That then the heart begins to reaſon as he in the <hi>Kings, If the Lord ſhould open the windows of heaven how ſhould this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay if his people ſtand in need of mirracles to work their deliverance, miracles fall as eaſily out of Gods hands, as to give his people daily bread. Gods bleſſing is many times ſecret upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that they know not which way it comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as 2 <hi>Kings, 3. 17.

Though the Lord had delivered the Ethiopian Army into his hands, conſiſting of a thouſand thouſand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. And good <hi>Jacob</hi> joyned in a lye with his mother to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was not content to ſtay Gods time, and uſe Gods means, but made too great haſte and ſtept out of his way, to procure the bleſſing which God intended for him; as many do through the corruption of their hearts and weakneſſe of their faith, becauſe they are not able to truſt God, and follow him fully in all things and alwaies; and for this cauſe the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follows the Saints with many ſore temperal croſſes, (as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi>) though they obtain the mercy. It may be thy wretched carnal heart thinks, I care not how I be

delivered, ſo I may but get free from it: Is it not ſo many times in ſome of your hearts when any croſſe or affliction befals you? Have not you ſuch kind of workings of ſpirit as this? Oh that I could but be delivered out of this affliction any way, I would not care, your hearts are far from being quiet. And this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhifting is the next thing in oppoſition to this quietneſſe, which God requires in a contented ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The Eighth and laſt thing that this quietneſſe of Spirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to, is <hi>deſparate riſings of heart againſt God in a way of rebellion:</hi> That is moſt abominable: I hope many of you have learned ſo far to be content, as to keep down your hearts from ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; and yet the truth is, not only wicked men, but ſometimes the very Saints of God find the beginnings of this, when an affliction lies long, and is very ſore and heavy upon them indeed, and ſtrikes them as it were in the maſter vein; they find ſomewhat of this in their hearts, a riſing againſt God, their thoughts begin to bubble, and their affections begin to ſtir in riſing againſt God himſelf; eſpecially ſuch as together with their corruptions have much melancholy, and the Devil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both upon the corruptions of their hearts, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſtemper of their bodies; though there may lie much grace at the bottom, yet there may be ſome riſings againſt God himſelf under affliction. Now Chriſtian quietnes is oppoſite to all theſe things: that is, When afflictions come, be it what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction it will be, yet you do not murmur, though you be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though you make your moan, though you deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and ſeek it by all good means, yet you do not murmur nor repine, you do not fret, nor vex, there is not that tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of ſpirit in you, there is not unſettledneſſe in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, there are not diſtracting fears in your hearts, no ſinking diſcouragements, no baſe ſhiftings, no riſings in rebellion any way againſt God: This is the quietneſſe of Spirit under an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that is the ſecond thing when the ſoul is ſo far able to bear an affliction as to keep quiet under it.</p>
               <p>Now the Third thing I would open in the diſcription is this, <hi>It is an inward, quiet, gracious [frame] of Spirit.</hi> It is a frame of Spirit, and then a gracious frame of Spirit. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is a Soul buſineſſe, Firſt it is inward; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly

quiet; Thirdly it is a quiet <hi>Frame</hi> of Spirit. [<hi>Frame</hi>] by that I mean theſe Three things: There are Three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable when I ſay, Contentment conſiſts in the quiet <hi>frame</hi> of the Spirit of a man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a grace that ſpreads it ſelf through the whole Soul:</hi> as thus, It is in the judgement, that is, The judgement of the Soul of a man or woman tends to quiet the heart, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am ſatisfied, that is one thing to be ſatisfied in ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and judgement, as thus, This is the hand of God; and this is that that is ſutable to my condition, or beſt for me; although I do not ſee the reaſon of the thing, yet I am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my judgement about it.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>it is in the thoughts of a man or woman:</hi> As my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſatisfied, ſo my thoughts are kept in order.</p>
               <p>And then it comes to the <hi>will, My will yeilds and ſubmits to it, my affections are all likewiſe kept in order, ſo that it goes through the whole ſoul.</hi> There is in ſome a partiall Contentment, and ſo tis not the frame of the ſoul, but ſome part of the ſoul hath ſome Contentment, as thus, Many a man may be ſatisfied in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about a thing, and yet cannot for his life rule his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor his thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot rule his thoughts, nor the will, nor the affections though the judgement be ſatisfied: I make no queſtion but many of you may know this by your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you do but obſerve the workings of your own hearts. Cannot you ſay when ſuch an affliction befals you, I can bleſſe God I am ſatisfied in my judgement about it, I have nothing in the world to ſay in reſpect of my judgement againſt it, I ſee the hand of God and I ſhould be content: yea I am ſatisfied in my judgement, that my condition is a good condition in which I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I cannot for my life rule my thoughts, and will, and my affections, me thinks I feel my heart heavy, and ſad, and troubled more then it ſhould be, and yet my judgement is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This ſeem'd to be the caſe of <hi>David, Pſal. 43. O my Soul why art thou diſquieted? David</hi> as far as his judgement went, there was a contentedneſſe, that is, His judgement was ſatisfied in the work of God upon him; and he was troubled, but he knew not wherefore, <hi>O my Soul why art thou caſt down within me?</hi> That Pſalm is a very good Pſalm for thoſe that feel a fretting, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He could not get this grace of Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>entment to go through the whole frame of the Soul; there is a great deal of ſtir ſometimes to get Contentment into their judgements, that is, To ſatisfie their judgement about their condition: Come to many, that the hand of God is upon perhaps in a greivous manner, and ſeek to ſatisfie them and tell them that there is no ſuch cauſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, O not ſuch cauſe ſaith the troubled ſpirit; O then there is no cauſe that any ſhould be diſquieted; there was never any ſuch affliction as I have, and a hundred things they have to put off what is ſaid to them, ſo as you cannot ſo much as get into their judgements to ſatisfie them; but there is a great deal of hope of Contentment if once your judgements come to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that you can ſit down and ſay in your judgements, I ſee cauſe to be contented; but though you have gotten thus far, yet you may have much to do with your hearts afterward: for there is ſuch unrulineſſe in our thoughts and affections, that our judgements are not able alwaies to rule our thoughts and affections, and that makes me to ſay, That Contentment is an inward, quiet, gracious frame of Spirit, that is, the whole Soul, Judgement, Thoughts, Will, Affections and all are ſatisfied and quiet. I ſuppoſe in the very opening this, you begin to ſee it is a leſſon that you had need learn, and it is not a thing ſoon got, if Contentment be ſuch a thing as this is.</p>
               <p>The Second thing is this, which is very obſervable, <hi>That ſpirituall contentment comes from the frame of the Soul.</hi> A man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is contented in a right way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Contentment doth not ſo much come from outward arguments, or any outward thing that helps them to be content, as it doth from the diſpoſition of their own hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the diſpoſition of their own hearts that cauſes this Contentment; that brings forth this gracious Contentment rather then any externall thing that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:130622:15"/>
doth it; as thus I would open my ſelf, one that is diſquieted, ſuppoſe a child or man, or woman, if you come and bring them ſome great matter to pleaſe them, that perhaps will quiet them, and they will be contented; it is the thing you bring them that quiets them, but it is not the diſpoſition of their own ſpirits, not from any good temper that there is in their own hearts, but from ſome externall thing that is brought them; but when a Chriſtian is contented in a right way, the quiet doth come more from the inward temper and diſpoſition of their own hearts then from any externall arguments, or poſſeſſion of any thing in the world. I would yet open this further to you in this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. The being content upon ſome externall thing, it is like the warming of a mans cloathes by the fire; but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by the inward diſpoſition of the ſoul, it is like the warmth that a mans cloathes hath from the naturall heat of his body: A man that is of a healthful body, he puts on his cloathes, and perhaps when he puts them on at the firſt in a cold morning he feels his cloathes cold, but after he hath them on a little while, they are warm; why how come they warm? they came not nigh the fire: No, but it came from the natural heat of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now a ſickly man that hath his naturall heat decayed, if he put on his cloathes cold, they will not be hot in a long time, but he muſt have them warmed by the fire, and then they will quickly be cold again; So this will difference the Contentments of men. There are ſome men now that are very gracious, and when an affliction comes upon them, indeed at firſt it ſeems to be a little cold, but after it hath been on a while, the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their hearts being gracious it makes their afflictions eaſie, and makes them to be quiet under it, and not to complain of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcontentment. But now you ſhall have others that have an affliction upon them, that have not this good temper in their hearts, their afflictions are very cold upon them and greivous; and it may be if you bring them ſome externall arguments, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from without, as the fire that warmes the cloathes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will be quiet for a while; but alas, wanting a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition within in their own hearts that warmth will not hold long. The warmth of the fire, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Contentment that comes meerly from externall arguments will not hold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130622:15"/>
long, but that holds that doth come from the gracious temper of the Spirit. It is from the frame and the diſpoſition of the ſpirit of a man or woman, there's the true Contentment. But this we ſhall ſpeak too further in the opening of the <hi>Myſtery of Contentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third thing is this, <hi>It is the frame of Spirit, that ſhewes the habitualneſſe of this grace of Contentment.</hi> Contentment is not meerly one act, a flaſh in a good moode; you ſhall have many men and women, that take them in ſome good moode and they will be very quiet; but this will not hold, this is not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way, there is not a conſtant tenour of their ſpirits to be holy and gracious under affliction. But I ſay, It is the quiet frame of ſpirit, by that I mean, The habitual diſpoſition of their Soules, that it is not only at this time, and the other time when you take men and women in a good moode, but it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour and temper of the heart; that is a Chriſtian that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, that in the conſtant tenour and temper of heart is contented, and can carry its ſelf quietly in a conſtant way, or elſe it is worth nothing; for there is no body that is ſo furious in their diſcontent, but will be quiet in ſome good moode or other. Now Firſt it is a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſineſſe; Secondly, it is the heart-quiet; and then Thirdly, it is the frame of the heart.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly, <hi>It is the [gracious] frame of the heart.</hi> Indeed in Contentment there is a compoſition of all graces if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment be Spirituall, if it be truly Chriſtian, there is I ſay a compoſition of all Spiritual graces; As it is in ſome Oyls, there is a compoſition of a great many very precious Ingredients, ſo in this grace of Contentment, which we ſhall yet further ſpeak of in the opening of the Excellency of it. But now the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame of Spirit is in oppoſition to Three things;</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, <hi>In oppoſition to the naturall ſtillneſſe that there is in many men and women.</hi> There is ſome of ſuch a natural conſtitution that makes them to be more ſtill and more quiet then others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others are of a violent and hot conſtitution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and they are more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient then others.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, <hi>In oppoſition to a ſturdy reſolution:</hi> As ſome men through the ſtrength of ſome ſturdy reſolution, they have not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130622:16"/>
ſeemed to be troubled let come what will come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo it may be that through a ſturdy reſolution at ſome times they are not ſo much diſquieted as others are.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In way of diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion, from the very ſtrength of reaſon</hi> (though not ſanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ified) <hi>the ſtrength of naturall reaſon may quiet the heart in ſome meaſure.</hi> But now I ſay, A gracious frame of ſpirit is not a meer ſtilneſſe of body through a naturall conſtitution and temper, nor ſturdineſſe of reſolution, nor meerly through the ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
               <p>You will ſay wherein is this graciouſneſſe of contentment diſtinguiſht from all theſe? More of this will be ſpoken to when we ſhew the myſtery of it, and the leſſons that are learned, but now we may ſpeak a little by way of diſtinction here, as now, from the natural ſtilneſſe of mens ſpirits, many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſuch a natural ſtilneſſe of ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſtitution of body, that you ſhall find them ſeldome diſquieted. But now mark theſe kind of people that are ſo, they likewiſe are very dull, of a dull ſpirit in any good thing, they have no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor livelineſſe of ſpirit in that which is good, but now mark where contentment of heart is gracious, the heart is very quick and lively in the ſervice of God, yea the more any gracious heart can bring its ſelf to be in a contented diſpoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h the more fit is it for any ſervice of God, and is very active and lively in Gods ſervice, not dull in the ſervice of God: And as a Contented heart is very active and ſtirring in the work of God, ſo hee is very active and ſtirring in ſanctifying Gods name in the affliction that doth befall him: The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will appear very cleer thus, One that is of a ſtill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not diſquieted indeed as others, neither hath he any activeneſſe of ſpirit in ſanctifying the name of God in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now one that is content in a gracious way as he is not diſquieted, but keeps his heart quiet in reſpect to vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trouble, ſo on the other ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de he is not dull nor heavy but is very active to ſanctifie Gods name in the affliction that is upon him, for it is not enough meerly not to murmur not to be diſcontented and troubled, but you muſt be active in the ſanctifying Gods name in the affliction. And indeed this will diſtinguiſh it from the other, from a ſturdy reſolution, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:130622:16"/>
will not be troubled: but though you have a ſturdy reſolution that you will not be troubled, is there a conſcionableneſſe in you to ſanctifie Gods name in your affliction, and doth it come from thence? That is the main thing that brings the quiet of heart, and helps againſt diſcontentedneſſe in a gracious heart. I ſay the deſire and care that thy ſoul hath to ſanctifie Gods name in an affliction it is that that quiets the ſoul, which doth not in the other. Neither when it is meerly from reaſon: As <hi>Socrates</hi> it is ſaid of him (though he were but a heathen) that what ever befel him he would never ſo much as chang his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and he got this power over his ſpirit meerly by ſtrength of reaſon and morallity, but now this gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment comes from principles beyond the ſtrength of reaſon. I cannot open that, (from whence it comes) till we come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the myſtery of ſpiritual Contentment. I will only give you this one note of the difference between a man and woman that is contented in a natural way, and another that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in a ſpiritual way. Thoſe that are contented in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way they overcome themſelves when outward afflictions doth befall them, they are contented, yea and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as well when they commit ſin againſt God, either when they have outward croſſes or when God is diſhonoured it is all one, either when themſelves are croſt or when God is croſt, but now a gracious heart that is contented with its own affliction, yet mightily riſes when God is diſhonoured.</p>
               <p>The fift is [<hi>Freely] freely ſubmitting to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe,</hi> it is a free work of the ſpirit, now there are four things to be opened in this freedome of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt that the heart is readily brought over, that that one doth freely there is no great ſtir to bring them to it, there are many men and women when their afflictions are greivious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with much adoe they are brought to be contented, a great deal of ſtir there is to quiet their hearts when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, yet at laſt perhaps they are brought to it, I but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow this doth not come off freely, if I deſire a thing of another and I get it perhaps with much adoe, and a great deal of ſtir there is, but here's no freedom of ſpirit, but when a man is free in a thing do but mention it and preſently he comes off to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130622:17"/>
it. So if you have learned this art of Contentment, you will not only be contented after a great deal of doe to quiet your hearts but readily, as ſoon as ever you do come to think that it is the hand of God, your heart preſently cloſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>freely, That is not by conſtraint,</hi> not patience by force (as we uſe to ſay.) As many will ſay that you muſt be content, this is the hand of God and there is no help for it; O this is too low an expreſſion for Chriſtians, yet when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians come to viſit one another, they ſay friend or neighbour you muſt be content, this is to low an expreſſion for a Chriſtian, <hi>Muſt be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent,</hi> no, readily, and freely I will be content. It is ſutable to my heart to yeild to God, and to be content, I find it is a thing that comes off of it ſelf, that my ſoul will be content. Oh you ſhould anſwer your friends ſo that come and tell you you muſt be content, nay I am willing to yeild to God, and I am freely content, that's the Second. And then a free act it comes after a rational way, that's freedom, that is, it doth not come through ignorance, becauſe I know no better condition, or that I know not what my affliction is, but it comes through a ſanctified judgement, for that is the reaſon that no creature can do an act of freedom, but the rational creature, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of action is only in rational creatures, and it comes from hence, for that's only freedom and out of liberty that's wrought in a rational way, as a natural freedom is when I by my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſee what is to be done, underſtand the thing, and then there is a cloſing with what I do underſtand in my judgement, that is freely done, but now if a man doth a thing, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not what he doth, he cannot be ſaid to do it freely. So if men are contented, but it is becauſe they underſtand not what their affliction is, or becauſe they underſtand no better, this is not freely, as for inſtance, Suppoſe a Child born in a priſon and never in all his life went out, the Child is content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why? Becauſe he never knew better, but this is no free act of Contentation, but now for men and women that do know better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that know that the condition in which they are in it is an afflicted condition, and a ſad condition, and yet they can bring their hearts to a Contentation out of a ſanctified judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:130622:17"/>Thirdly, <hi>This freedom it is in oppoſition to ſtupidneſs,</hi> for a man and woman may be contented meerly out of want of ſenſe, this is not free, as a man in a dead palſie that doth not feel you nip his fleſh, he is not freely patient; but if one ſhould have their fleſh nipt, and feel it, and yet for all that can be able to bridle themſelves, and do it freely, that is another matter. So it is here, many are contented meerly out of ſtupidneſſe, they have a dead palſie upon them; but now a gracious heart hath ſenſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and yet is contented, and therefore is free.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Freely [ſubmitting] to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> Submitting to Gods diſpoſe, What is that? The word <hi>Submit,</hi> it ſignifies nothing elſe, but to ſend under; as thus, One that is diſcontented, the heart will be unruly, and would even get above God ſo far as diſcontentment prevailes; but now comes the grace of Contentment and ſends it under; to ſubmit, it is to ſend under a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now when the ſoul comes to ſee the unrulineſſe that there is in it, here's the hand of God that brings an affliction, and my heart is troubled and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; what ſaith the Soul? Wilt thou be above God? Is it not Gods hand, and muſt thy will be regarded more then Gods? O under, under, O thou ſoul get under, keep under, keep low, keep under Gods feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou art under Gods feet, and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, keep under the Authority of God, the Majeſty of God, the Soveraignity of God, the Power that God hath over thee: Keep under, that is to ſubmit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Soul can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God when it can ſend its ſelf under the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Soveraignity, and Dominion that God hath over it; that is the Sixth Particuler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea but that is not enough, yet you have not got to this Grace of Contentment, except in the next place you take.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Taking a [complacency] in Gods diſpoſe.</hi> That is thus, I am well pleaſed in what God doth, ſo far as I can ſee God in it, though as I ſaid, I may be ſenſible of the affliction, and may deſire that God in his due time would take it off, and uſe meanes to take it off; yet I may be well pleaſed ſo far as Gods hand is in it. To be well pleaſed with Gods hand, that is a higher degree then the other; and this comes from hence, not only becauſe I ſee that I ſhould be content in this affliction, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130622:18"/>
becauſe I ſee that there is good in this affliction. I find there is hony in this rock, and ſo I do not only ſay, I <hi>muſt,</hi> or I <hi>will</hi> ſumit to Gods hand; no, but the hand of God is <hi>good;</hi> it <hi>is good that I am afflicted.</hi> That it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly:</hi> Perhaps ſome of you may ſay as <hi>David,</hi> It is good that I was afflicted; nay, you muſt come to ſay thus, <hi>It is good that I am afflicted.</hi> Not good when you ſee the good fruit that it hath wrought, but when you are afflicted to ſay, It is good that I am afflicted. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the affliction be, yet through the mercy of God my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a good condition; it is the top indeed and the height of this art of Contentment to come to this pitch, to be able to ſay, Well, my condition and afflictions are thus and thus, and is very greivous and ſore yet I am through Gods mercy in a good condition, and the hand of God is good upon me notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now I ſhould have given you divers Scriptures about this, I ſhall but give you one or two that are very remarkable; you will think this is a hard leſſon to come thus far, not only to be quiet, but to have a complacency in affliction. <hi>Prov. 16. 6. In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure, but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</hi> Here is a Scripture now that will ſhew that a gracious heart hath cauſe to ſay it is in a good condition what ever it be. In the houſe of the Righteous is much treaſure, his houſe, what houſe? it may be a poor Cottage, perhaps he hath ſcarce a ſtoole to ſit on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps he is fain to ſit upon a ſtump of wood, a piece of a block, inſtead of a ſtool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or perhaps he hath ſcarce a bed to lye upon, or a diſh to eat in yet ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure: Let the righteous man be the pooreſt man in the world: It may be there are ſome that hath come and taken all the goods out of his houſe for debt; perhaps his houſe is plundered and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:130622:18"/>
all is gon, yet ſtill, <hi>In the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure,</hi> the righteous man can never be brought to be ſo poor, to have his houſe rifled and ſpoiled, but there will remain much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within, if he hath but a diſh or a ſpoon or any thing in the world in his houſe there will be much treaſure, ſo long as he is there, there is the preſence of God and the bleſſing of God upon him, and therein is much treaſure; but in the revenues of the wicked there is trouble: There is more treaſure in the pooreſt bodies houſe, if he be godly, then in the houſe of the greateſt man in the world, that hath his brave hangings, and brave wrought beds, and chairs, and couches, and cubbords of plate, and the like; what ever he hath, he hath not ſo much treaſure in it, as in the houſe of the pooreſt righteous ſoul; therefore in a <hi>verſe,</hi> or two after my text, no mervail though <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he) was Content, you ſhall ſee in <hi>Phil. 4. 18. But I have all, and abound, I am full.</hi> I have all? Alas poor man what had <hi>Paul</hi> that could make him ſay he had all; where was there ever man more afflicted then <hi>Paul</hi> was? many times he had not tatters to hang about his body, to cover his nakedneſſe, he had not bread to eate, he was often in nakedneſſe, and put in the ſtocks, and whipt and cruelly uſed, <hi>yet</hi> I <hi>have all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) for all that. Yea you ſhall have it in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. he profeſſes there, <hi>That he did poſſeſſe all things, as ſorowful, yet alwaies rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things,</hi> but mark what he ſaith, it is, <hi>As having nothing,</hi> but it is <hi>Poſſeſſing all things.</hi> He doth not ſay, as poſſeſſing all things, but poſſeſſing all things; it is very little I have in the world, but yet poſſeſſing all things: So that you ſee a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath cauſe to take complacency in Gods hand, whatſoever his hand be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eight thing in Contentment it is [In Gods diſpoſe] Submitting to, and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe,</hi> that is, the ſoul that hath learned this leſſon of Contentment, looks up to God in all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looks not down to the inſtruments or the means, as ſuch a man did it, and it was the unreaſonableneſſe of ſuch and ſuch inſtruments and the like barbarous uſage of ſuch and ſuch; but looks up to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a contented heart looks to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And ſubmits to Gods diſpoſe, that is, ſees the wiſdom of

Can you in every condition be content not onely for the matter, but for the time, that is to be in ſuch a condition ſo long as God would have you, to be content to be at Gods time in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have ſuch an affliction ſo long as God would have the affliction abide upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be willing to ſtay and not to come out of the affliction no ſooner then the Lord would have you come out of it? you are not content in your condition elſe; to be content meerly that I have ſuch a hand of God upon me, and not to ſlay under the hand of God, that is not to be content under every condition, but when I can find my heart ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Gods diſpoſe in ſuch particuler afflictions that are very hard, and very greivious, and yet my heart is quiet, here is one that hath learned the leſſon of Contentment: Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the inward, quiet, gracious frame of ſpirit, freely ſubmitting to and taking complacency in Gods diſpoſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition: That is the diſcription: Now in this there hath been nine ſeveral things opened.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have made entrance you may remember into the Argument of Chriſtian Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And have opened the words and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you what this Chriſtian Contentation is; that it is, The inward, quiet, gracious frame of Spirit, freely ſubmitting too, and taking Complacency in Gods diſpoſe in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And therein came to this laſt thing, [<hi>In every condition</hi>] Now we ſhall a little inlarge that, and ſo proceed:</p>

               <p>Let them be what they will, yet there muſt be a ſubmitting to Gods diſpoſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the kind, many men and women will in the general ſay, that they muſt ſubmit to God in affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſuppoſe now if you ſhould come from one end of this congregation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpeak to every ſoul thus, would not you ſubmit to Gods diſpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in what ever condition he ſhould diſpoſe of you too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>There is a great deal of deceit in generals,</hi> in general you would ſubmit to any thing: but what if it be in this and that particuler, that is moſt croſſe to you? Then any thing but that; we are uſually apt to think that any condition is better
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:130622:20"/>
then the condition that God doth diſpoſe us too, now here is not Contentment; it ſhould not be only to any condition in general, but for the kind of the affliction, if it be that which is moſt croſſe to you. God it may be ſtriks you in your Child, Oh if it had been in my eſtate ſaith one, I ſhould be content; perhaps he ſtriks you in your match, Oh ſaith he I had rather have been ſtrucken in my health; and if he had ſtruck you in your health, Oh then if it had been in my trading I would not have cared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we muſt not be our own carvers, what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular afflictions God ſhall diſpoſe us to, there muſt be Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There muſt be a ſubmiſſion to God in every affliction, for the time and continuance of the affliction.</hi> It may be ſaith one I could ſubmit and be content, but this affliction hath been upon me a long time, a quarter of a year, a year, divers years, and I know not how to yeild and ſubmit to it, my patience is even worn and broak, yea it may be it is a ſpiritual affliction, you could ſubmit to God you ſay in any outward affliction, but not in a ſoul affliction, or if it were an affliction upon the ſoul, trouble upon the heart, if it were the withdrawing of Gods face, yet if this had been but for a little time I could ſubmit; but ſeeking of God ſo long a time and yet God doth not appear, Oh how ſhall I bear this? We muſt not be our own diſpoſers for the <hi>time</hi> of deliverance no more then for the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of deliverance, and I will give you a Scripture or two about this. That we are to ſubmit unto God for the time as well as the kind, in the latter end of the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Ezek. When I ſaw it I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that ſpake,</hi> (the Prophet was caſt down upon his face, but how long muſt he lie upon his face) <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of man ſtand upon thy feet and I will ſpeak unto thee, and the ſpirit entered into me, when he ſpake unto me and ſet me upon my feet. Fzekiel</hi> was caſt down upon his face, and there he muſt lye till God bid him ſtand up, yea and not only ſo, but till Gods Spirit came into him and enabled him to ſtand up: So when God caſts us down, we muſt be content to lie till God bid us ſtand up, and Gods Spirit enter into us to inable us to ſtand up. So you know <hi>Noah</hi> he was put into the Ark, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he knew there was much affliction in the Ark, having all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:130622:21"/>
kind of creatures ſhut up with him for twelve months together, it was a mighty thing, yet God ſhutting him up (though the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were aſſwaged) <hi>Noah</hi> was not to come out of the Ark till God bid him: So though we be ſhut up in great afflictions, and we may think there may be this and that and the other means to come out of that affliction, yet till God doth open the door we ſhould be willing to ſtay; God hath put us in, and God is to bring us out: As we read in the Acts, of <hi>Paul,</hi> when they had ſhut him in Priſon and would have ſent for him out; Nay, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> they ſhutus in, let them come and fetch us out: So in a holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way ſhould a ſoul ſay, Well, this affliction that I am brought into, it is by the hand of God, and I am content to be here till God brings me out himſelf. God doth require it at our hands that we ſhould not be willing to come out till he comes and fetches us out. In <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4. 10. you have a notable hiſtory there that may very well ſerve our purpoſe; we read of the Prieſts, that the Prieſts bare the Ark and ſtood in the middeſt of Jordan; you know when the Children of Iſrael went into the land of Canaan they went through the River of Jordan: Now the going through the river Jordan was a very dangerous thing, only God bad them to go, they might have been afraid that the water might have come in upon them: Put mark, it is ſaid, <hi>The Prieſts that bare the Arke ſtood in the middeſt of Jordan till every thing was finiſhed that the Lord commanded</hi> Joſhua <hi>to ſpeak unto the people, according to all that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded</hi> Joſhua, <hi>and the people haſted and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And then for the varietie of our condition, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the particular affliction, and the time, and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances about the affliction for ſome times the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are greater afflictions then the afflictions themſelues And for the varietie, if God will exerciſe us with various afflictions one after another: As that hath bin very obſervable even of late, that many that have been plundered and come away, afterwards have fallen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Oh that it could be ſaid ſo of many Chriſtians, that though their conditions be changed yet that nobody could ſee <hi>them</hi> changed, they are the ſame. Look what gracious ſweete and holy temper they were in before, that they are in ſtill: thus we are to ſubmit to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God in every condition.</p>

if we could attaine to it, but is it poſſible for one to attain to this?</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is if you get skill in the Art of it, you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it, and it will prove to be no ſuch difficult thing to you neither, if you underſtood but the myſtery of it, as theres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that men do in their callings, that if a countrey man comes and ſees, he thinks it a mighty hard thing, and that he ſhould never be able to do it, but that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now that's the buſines of this exerciſe, to open unto you the art and myſtery of contentment: What way a Chryſtian comes to contentment, there is a great Myſtery and art in it, by that that hath bin opened to you there will appeare ſome myſtery and art, as that a man ſhould be content with his affliction and yet throughly ſenſible of his affliction too, to be throughly ſenſible of an affliction, and to endeavour the removing of it by all lawfull meanes, and yet to be content, there's a myſtery in that, how to joyne theſe two together to be ſenſible of an affliction as much as that man or woman that is not content, I am ſenſible of it as fully as they, and I ſeeke wayes to be delivered from it as well as they, and yet ſtill my heart abides content, this is I ſay a myſtery that is very hard to be underſtood by a carnall heart; but grace doth teach ſuch a mixture, doth teach us how to make a mixture of ſorrow and a mixture of joy together; and that makes contentment, the mingling of joy and ſorrow, of gracious joy and gracious ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row together grace, teaches us how to moderate and to order an affliction ſo as there ſhall be a ſence of it, and yet for all that contentment under it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are divers things further for the opening of the myſtery of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Thing therefore is this, <hi>To ſhew that there is a great miſtery in it.</hi> One that is contented in a Chriſtian way it may be ſaid of him that he is the moſt <hi>contented</hi> man in the world, and yet the moſt <hi>unſatiſfied</hi> man in the world, theſe two together muſt needs be myſterious, I ſay a contented man as he is the moſt contented ſo he is the moſt unſatiſfied of any man in the world.

it may be ſaid of you that as you are the moſt contented man ſo you are the moſt unſatisfied man in the world.</p>
               <p>You will ſay how is that? A man that hath learned the art of contentment is the moſt contented with any low condition that he hath in the world, and yet he cannot be ſatisfied with the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oyment of all the world, and yet he is contented if he hath but a cruſt, but bread and water, that is if God diſpoſes of him for the things of the world to have but bread and water for his preſent condition, he can be ſatisfied with Gods diſpoſe in that, yet if God ſhould give unto him Kingdomes and Empiers, all the world to rule, if he ſhould give it him for his portion he would not be ſatisfied with that, here's the myſtery of it, though his heart be ſo inlarged as the injoyment of all the world and ten thouſand worlds cannot ſatisfie him for his portion; yet he hath a heart quieted under Gods diſpoſe, if he gives him but bread and water, to joyn theſe two together, this muſt needs be a great art and myſtery. Though he be contented with God in a little, yet thoſe things that would content other men will not content him. The men of the world they ſeek after eſtates, and think if they had thus much, and thus much, they would be content, they aime at no great matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if I had (perhaps ſome man thinks) but two or three hundred a year, then I ſhould be well enough; If I had but a hundred a year, or a thouſand a year (ſaith another) then I ſhould be ſatisfied: but ſaith a gracious heart, If he had ten hundred thouſand times ſo much a year, it would not ſatisfie him, if he had the quinteſcence of all the excellencies of all the creatures in the world, it could not ſatisfie him, and yet this man can ſing, and be merry, and joyfull when he hath but a cruſt of bread and a little water in the world: Surely Religion is a great myſtery.

Marke, here lyes the Myſtery of it, A little in the world will Content a CHRISTIAN for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but all the world and ten thouſand times more will not content a Chriſtian for his portion: Now a carnal heart will be content with theſe things of the world for his portion; and there is the difference between a Carnal heart and a gracious heart: But ſaith a gracious heart, Lord do with me what thou wilt for my paſſage through this world; I will be content with that, but I cannot be content with all the world for my portion: ſo there is the myſtery of true Contentation. A contented man though he be moſt contented with the leaſt things in the world, yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man that lives in the world. That Soul that is capable of God, can be filled with nothing elſe but God; nothing but God can fill a ſoul that is capable of God: though a gracious heart knowes that it is capable of God, and was made for God, Carnal hearts think of no reference to God, but a gracious heart being inlarged to be capable of God, and injoying ſomewhat of him; nothing in the world can fill a gracious heart, it muſt be only God himſelf; and therefore you ſhall obſerve, That let God give what he will to a gracious heart, a heart that is godly, except he gives himſelf, it will not do. A godly heart will not only have the mercy, but the God of that mercy as well as its ſelf; and then a little matter is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the world, ſo be it he hath the God of that mercy he doth injoy. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. 9. I ſhall need go no further to ſhew a notable Scripture for this; Compare verſ. 7. with verſ. 9. <hi>And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The peace of God ſhall keep your hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then in verſ. 9. <hi>Thoſe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you, The peace of God ſhall keep you, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> This is that that I would obſerve from this Text, That the peace of God is not enough to a gracious heart except it may have the God of that peace. A Carnal heart could be ſatisfied if he might but have outward peace, though it be not the peace of God; peace in the ſtate and his trading would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him. But mark how a godly heart goes beyond a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, all outward peace is not enough, but I muſt have the peace
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:130622:25"/>
of God: But ſuppoſe you have the peace of God, Will not that quiet you? No, I muſt have the God of peace, as the peace of God ſo the God of peace, that is, I muſt injoy that God that gives me the peace, I muſt have the cauſe as well as the effect; I muſt ſee from whence my peace comes, and injoy the fountain of my peace, as well as the ſtream of my peace; and ſo in other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have I health from God, I muſt have the God of my health to be my portion, or elſe I am not ſatisfied: It is not life, but the God of my life; it is not riches, but the God of thoſe riches that I muſt have, the God of my preſervation, as well as my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; a gracious heart is not ſatisfied without this, To have the God of the mercy, as well as the mercy. In <hi>Pſal. 73. 25. Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon the earth that I deſiere beſides thee.</hi> It is nothing in heaven or earth, can ſatisfie me, but thy ſelf; if God give thee not only earth but heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt rule over ſun, moon, and ſtars, &amp; have the rule over the higheſt of the ſons of men, it would not be enough to ſatisfie thee, except thou hadeſt God himſelf; There lies the firſt myſtery of Contentment &amp; truly a contented man, though he be the moſt contented man in the world, yet he is the moſt unſatisfied man in the world, that is, Thoſe things that will ſatisfie the world, will not ſatisfie him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this Myſtery in Chriſtian Contentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>A Chriſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by way of addition, as by way of ſubſtraction,</hi> that is his way of Contentment, and that is a way that the world hath no skil in. I open it thus, Not ſo much by the adding to what he would have, or to what he hath, not by adding more to his condition, but rather by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting of his deſires, and ſo to make his deſires and condition to be even and equal. A carnal heart knows no way to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented but this, I have ſuch and ſuch an eſtate, and if I had this added to it, and the other comfort added that now I have not, then I ſhould be Contented; it may be I have loſt my eſtate, if I could have but that given to me ſo as to make up my loſſe, then I ſhould be a contented man: But now Contentment doth not come in that way, it comes not in I ſay by the adding to what thou wanteſt, but by the ſubſtracting of thy deſires; it is all one to a Chriſtian, either that I may get up unto what I

would have, or get my deſires down to what I have; either that I may attain to what I do deſire, or bring down my deſires to what I have already attained; my eſtate is the ſame, for it is as ſutable to me to bring my deſire down to my condition, as it is to raiſe up my condition to my deſire. Now I ſay a heart that hath no grace, and is not inſtructed in this Myſtery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, knows no way to get Contentment, but to have his eſtate raiſed up to his deſires; but the other hath another way to Contentment, that is, He can bring his deſires down to his eſtate, and ſo he doth attain to his Contentment. So the Lord faſhions the hearts of the Children of men: Now if the heart of a man be faſhioned to his condition, he may have as much contentment as if his condition be faſhioned to his heart; ſome men have a mighty large heart, but they have a ſtreight condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they can never have Contentment, when their hearts are big and their condition is little; but now though a man cannot bring his condition to be as big as his heart, yet if he can bring his heart to be as little as his condition, to bring them even, from thence is Contentment. The world is infinitly deceived in this, To think that Contentment lyes in having more then they have; here lyes the bottom and root of all Contentment, when there is an evenneſſe and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our hearts and our conditions; and that is the reaſon that many that are godly men that are in a low condition live more ſweet and comfortable lives then thoſe that are richer: Contentment is not alwaies cloathed with ſilk, and purple, and velvets, but Contentment is ſometimes in a ruſſet ſuit, in a mean condition, as well as in a higher; and many men that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have had great eſtates, and God hath brought them into a lower condition, they have had more contentment in that condition then the other. Now how can that poſſibly be? Thus eaſily, For if you did but underſtand the root of Contentment it conſiſts in the ſutableneſſe and proportion of the ſpirit of a man to his eſtate, and the evenneſſe, when one end is not longer and bigger then another; the heart is contented, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that condition; now let God give a man never ſo great riches, yet if the Lord gives him up to the pride of his heart, he will never be contented: But now, let God bring any one into
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:130622:26"/>
a mean condition, and then let God but faſhion and ſute his heart to that condition and he will be content. As now in a mans going, Suppoſe a man had a mighty long leg, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leg were ſhort, why though one of his legs be longer then ordinary, yet he could not go ſo well as a man that hath both his legs ſhorter then he. I compare a long leg, when one is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then another, to a man that hath a high condition, and is very rich, and a great man in the world, but he hath a great proud heart too, and that is longer and larger then his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; now this man cannot but be troubled in his condition: Now another man that is in a mean condition, his condition is low, and his heart is low too; ſo that his heart and his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both even together, and this man goes on with more eaſe abundantly then the other doth: So that now a gracious heart works after this manner, The Lord hath been pleaſed to bring down my condition, now if the Lord bring down my heart and make it even with my condition, then I am well enough: And ſo when God brings down his condition, he doth not ſo much labour to raiſe up his condition again as to bring down his heart to his condition. The Heathens themſelves they had a little glimps of this; they could ſay, That the beſt riches that is, it is the poverty of deſires: that is a ſpeech of a Heathen, that is, If a man or woman have their deſires cut ſhort, and have no large deſires, that man and woman they are rich when they can bring their deſires to be but low: So this is the Art of Contentment. Not to ſeeke to adde to our conditions, but to ſubſtract from our deſires. Another hath this, The way to be rich, ſaith he, it is not by increaſing of wealth, but by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our deſires; for certainly that man or woman is a rich man or woman that hath their deſires ſatisfied: now a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man hath his deſires ſatisfied, God ſatisfies his deſires, that is, all conſidered, he is ſatisfied in his condition for the preſent to be the beſt condition, and ſo he comes to this Contentment by way of Subſtraction, and not Addition.</p>
               <p>The Third thing in the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian comes to Contentment, not ſo much by getting off his burden that is upon him, as by the adding another burden to him;</hi> this is a way that fleſh and blood hath little skill in. You will ſay how is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:130622:27"/>
this? In this manner, art thou afflicted, and is there a great load and burden upon thee by reaſon of thy affliction, thou thinkeſt there is no way in the world to get Contentment, but, O that this burden were but off, O it is a heavy load, and few know what a burden I have. What doeſt thou think, there is no way for the Contentment of thy ſpirit, but this getting off thy burden? O thou art deceived, the way of Contentment is to adde another burden, that is, labour to load and burden thy heart with thy ſin, and the heaviour the burden of thy ſin is to thy heart, the lighter will the burden of thy affliction be to thy heart, and ſo ſhalt thou come to be Content: If thy burden were lightened that would content thee, thou thinkeſt there is no way to lighten it but to get it off, but thou art deceived, for if thou canſt get thy heart to be more burdened with thy ſin, thou wilt be leſſe burdened with thy afflictions: You will ſay this is a ſtrange way, for a man or woman to get eaſe to their condition, when they are burdened, to lay a greater burden upon them? You think there is no other way when you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflicted, but to be jolly and merry, and get into company, Oh no, you are deceived, your burden will come again, alas this is a poor way to get his ſpirit quieted, poor man, the burden will be upon him again; but it thou wouldeſt have thy burden light, if thou canſt get alone and examine thy heart for thy ſin, and charge thy ſoul with thy ſin; if thy burden be in thy eſtate, for the abuſe of it, or if it be a burden upon thy body, for the abuſe of thy health, and ſtrength, and the abuſe of any mercies that now the Lord hath taken away from thee, thou haſt not honoured God with thoſe mercies that thou haſt had, but thou haſt walked wantonly and careleſly; and ſo fall a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oning thy ſin before the Lord, and thou ſhalt quickly find the burden of thy affliction to be lighter then it was before; do but try this peece of skill and art, to get your ſouls contented with any low condition that God puts you into; many times in a family, when any affliction befals them, Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a deal of diſcontentment is there between man and wife, if croſt in their eſtates at land, or ill news from Sea, or they that they truſted are broak and the like, and perhaps ſomwhat in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily fals croſſe between man and wife, or in reference to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:130622:27"/>
children or ſervants, and there is nothing but brabling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content among them, now they many times are burdened with their own diſcontent, and perhaps will ſay one to another, this life is very uncomfortable for us to live thus diſcontented ſo as we do, but have you ever tried this way, the husband and the wife? have you ever got alone and ſaid, come, Oh let us go and humble our ſouls before God together, let us go into our chamber and humble our ſouls before God for our ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have abuſed thoſe mercies, that God hath taken away from us, and we have provokt God againſt us, Oh let us charge our ſelves with our ſin, and be humbled before the Lord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have you tried ſuch a way as this is? Oh you would find the cloud would be taken away, and the ſun would ſhine in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and you would have a great deal more Contentment then ever yet you had: If a mans eſtate be broken, either by blunderers, or any other way; now how ſhall this man have Contentment? how? By the breaking of his heart, God hath broken thy eſtate, Oh ſeek to him for the breaking of thy heart likewiſe, Indeed a broken eſtate, and a whole heart, a hard heart, will not joyn together, there will be no Contentment, but a broken eſtate, and a broken heart, will ſo ſute together, as there will be more Contentment then there was before adde therefore to the breaking of thy eſtate, the breaking of thy heart what thou canſt, and that is the way to be Contented in a Chriſtian manner, which is the Third Myſtery in Chriſtian Contentation.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is this, <hi>it is not ſo much the removing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that is upon us, as the changing of the affliction, the Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing of the affliction, when it is quite turned and changed into another thing.</hi> I meane in regard of the uſe of it, though for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the affliction abide ſtil. The way of contentment to a carnall heart it's only the removing of the affliction, O that it may be gone; no but ſaith a gracious heart, God hath taught me a way for contentment though the affliction ſhall continue ſtill for the matter of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there is a vertue of grace to turn this affliction into good; it takes away but only the ſting and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; As now, Suppoſe poverty, A mans eſtate is loſt; well, is there no way to be contented till your eſtate be made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:130622:28"/>
up again? Till your poverty be removed? yes, certainly chriſtianity would teach contentment, though poverty conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues yet it will teach you how to turn your poverty to ſpirtual riches; that you ſhall be pore ſtill for your outward eſtate; but this ſhall be altered, whereas before it was once a naturall evill to you, it comes now to be turned to a ſpirituall benefit to you. And ſo you come to be content; it is a ſpeech of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> Even <hi>poverty its ſelfe it is riches unto holy men,</hi> godly men do make their poverty turn to be riches, they get more riches out of thir poverty then ever they get out of their revenues, out of all their trading in this world they never had ſuch incomes as they have had out of their poverty, this a carnall heart will thinke ſtrange, that a man ſhall make pouerty to be the moſt gainfull trade that ever he had in the world, I am perſwaded that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chriſtians have found it ſo, that they have got more good by their poverty then ever they got by all their riches, you find it in ſcripture, therefore thinke not this ſtarnge that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, you doe not find any one Godly man that came out of an affliction worſe then when he came into it, though for a while he was ſhaken, yet at laſt he was better for an affliction; but a great many Godly men you find have been worſe for their proſperity, ſcarce one Godly man that you read in ſcripture of but was worſe for proſperity (except <hi>Daniell</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> I doe not read of any hurt they got by their proſperity that they had) ſcarce (I thinke) is any one example of any Godly man, but was rather worſe for his proſperitie then better; ſo that you ſee it's no ſuch ſtrange thing, neither to one that is gracious that they ſhall get good by their affliction, <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his comment upon the 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in the 17 verſe in his comment upon that place ſaith he, <hi>A chriſtian becometh a mighty worker and a wonderfull creator,</hi> that is (ſaith he) to create out of heavineſſe, joy, out of terrour comfort, out of ſin righteouſneſſe, and out of death life, and brings light out of darkeneſſe. It was Gods prerogative and great power, his creating power to comand the light to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhine out of darkeneſſe, now a Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ian is partaker of the divine nature ſo the ſcripture ſaith; grace it is part of the divine nature, and being part of the divine nature it hath an impreſſion of Gods Omnipotent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:130622:28"/>
power, that is, to create light out of darkenſſe, to bring good out of evill, now by this way a Chriſtian comes to be content. God hath given a Chriſtian ſuch avertue, as can turn affliction into mercyes, can turn darkeneſſe into light, if a man had the power that Chriſt had when the water pots were fill'd, he could by a word turn the water into wine, if you that have nothing but water to drinke yet if you had a power to turn it into wine then you may be contented: Certainly a Chriſtian hath received this power from God, to worke thus miraculouſly; It is the nature of grace to turn water into wine, that is, to turn the water of your affliction, into the wine of heavenly conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you underſtand this in a carnall way, I know it will be rediculous for a Miniſter to ſpeake thus before you, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carnal people are ready to make ſuch expreſſions as theſe to be rediculous, underſtanding them in a carnall way: Juſt as <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> in the third of John, <hi>what can a man be borne when he is old, can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be borne?</hi> ſo when we ſpeake of grace that it can turn water into wine, and turn poverty into riches, and make poverty a gainefull trade, ſaith a carnall heart let them have that trade if they will, and let them have water to drinke, and ſee if they can turn it into wine, Oh take heed thou ſpeakeſt not in a ſcornefull way, of the wayes of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace hath the power to turn afflictions into mercyes. Two men ſhall have one affliction, and to one man it ſhall be as gall and wormewood, and it ſhall be wine, and honey, and delightfullneſſe, and joy, and advantage, and riches, to another. This is the myſtery of contentment, not ſo much by removing the evill, as by Metamorphoſing the evill by changing the evill into good.</p>
               <p>The Fifth thing is this, <hi>A Chriſtian comes to this Contentment by making up the wants of his condition by the performance of the work of his condition.</hi> This is the way of Contentment. There is ſuch a condition that I am in, many wants, I want this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort, well, how ſhall I come to be ſatisfied and content? A carnall heart thinks this, I muſt have my wants made up or elſe it is impoſſible that I ſhould be content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, but ſaith a gracious heart, What is the duty of the condition God hath put me into? Indeed my condition is changed, I was not long
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:130622:29"/>
ſince in a proſperous condition, but God hath changed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: the Lord hath called me no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah:</hi> Now what am I to do? what can I think now are thoſe duties that God requires of me in the condition that he hath now put me into? And let me put forth my ſtrength, in the performance of the duties of my preſent condition. Others they ſpend their thoughts in thoſe things that ſhall diſturbe and diſquiet them; and ſo they grow more and more diſcontented; yea, but let me ſpend my thoughts in thinking what my duty is, what is the duty of my preſent condition which I am in? O ſaith a man whoſe condition is changed and he hath loſt his eſtate, Had I but my eſtate as I had heretofore, how would I uſe it to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? But God hath made me to ſee that I did not honour him with my eſtate as I ought to have done: O had I it again, I would do better then ever I did, but this may be but a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore you ſhould rather think, What doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me in the condition I am now brought into? And thou ſhouldeſt labour to bring thy heart to quiet and Contentment, by ſetting thy ſoul on work about the duties of thy preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And the truth is, I know nothing more available for the quieting of a Chriſtian Soul, and getting Contentment then this, The ſetting thy heart on work about the duties of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſent condition that now thou art in, and take heed of thy thoughts about other conditions as a meer temptation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compare the folly of men and women, that think to get Contentment with their muſing about other conditions better then to the way of Children; perhaps they are gotten upon a hill, and they look a good way off and ſee another hill, and they think if they were on the top of that, then they were able to touch the clouds with their fingers; but when they are on the top of that hill; alas then they are as far from the clouds, as they were before: So it is with many that think, If they were in ſuch a Condition, then I ſhould have Contentment; and perhaps they get into that condition, then they are as far from Contentment as before: But then they think if they were in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother condition, they would be contented, and then when they have got into that condition, they are ſtill as far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as before. No, no, let me conſider what is the duty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:130622:29"/>
of my preſent condition, and content my heart with this, and ſay, Well, though I am in a low condition, yet I am ſerving the counſels of God in that condition wherein I am; it is the counſell of God that hath brought me into this condition that I am in, and I deſire to ſerve the counſell of God in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is a notable Scripture concerning <hi>David,</hi> it is ſaid of him, That he ſerved his Generation, after <hi>David</hi> had ſerved his Generation according to the will of God, then he ſlept. It is a Speech of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning him in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 36. So it is in your books, <hi>After he had ſerved his generation according to the will of God:</hi> But now the word that is tranſlated <hi>will,</hi> it is the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of God,</hi> and ſo it may be tranſlated as well, <hi>That after</hi> David <hi>in his generation had ſerved Gods councel, then he fell aſleep.</hi> We or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily take the words thus, That <hi>David ſerved his generation;</hi> that is, He did the work of his generation, that is to ſerve a mans generation. But it is more plain, if you read it thus, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>David</hi> in his generation had ſerved the Counſell of God, then <hi>David</hi> fell aſleep. O that ſhould be the care of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to ſerve out Gods Counſels. What is the Councell of God? The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I am in, God doth put me into it by his own Counſell, the Councell of his own will; Now I muſt ſerve Gods Councell in my generation, look what is the Councell of God in my condition, I muſt look to ſerve that; and ſo I ſhall have my heart quieted for the preſent, and ſhall live and dye peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and comfortably, if I be carefull to ſerve Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
               <p>A Sixt thing in the myſtery of contentment is this, <hi>A gracious heart is conteted by the melting of his will and deſires into Gods will and deſires,</hi> by this meanes he gets contentment; and this is a myſtery to a carnall heart. It is not by having his owne deſires ſatisfied as before, but by melting his will and deſires into Gods will. So that he comes to have (in one ſenſe) his deſires ſatisfied though he hath not the thing that before he did deſire, yet he comes to be ſatisfied in this, becauſe he makes his will to be all one with Gods will. This is a little higher degree then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the will of God. You all ſay, you ſhould ſubmit to Gods will: but a Chriſtian hath gotten beyond this; that is, he can make Gods will and his to be the ſame: So it is ſaid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:130622:30"/>
of beleevers, that they are joyned to the Lord, and are one ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, that is, look what Gods will is, I do not only ſee reaſon to ſubmit to it, but Gods will is my will: When the ſoul can make over (as it were) its will to God, it muſt needs then have Contentment. Others would fain get the thing they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, O but ſaith a gracious heart, that that God would have, I would have too, I will not only yeild to it, but I would have it too, a gracious heart hath learned this art, not only to make the commanding will of God to be its own will, that is, what God commands me to do I will do it, but to make the providential will of God, and the operative will of God to be his will too: God commands this thing, which perhaps you that are Chriſtians may have ſome skill in, but whatſoever God works, you muſt will as well as what God commands, you muſt make Gods providential will, and his opperative will, as well your will, as Gods will, and ſo you muſt come to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, here a Chriſtian makes over his will to God, and in making over his will to God, he hath no other will but, only Gods; as ſuppoſe a man makes over his debt to another man, if that man that I owe the debt too, be ſatisfied and contented, I am ſatisfied becauſe I have made it over to him, and I need not be diſcontented and ſay, my debt is not paid and I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, yes, you are ſatisfied, for he that you made over your debt too, he is ſatisfied: Juſt thus it is for all the world between God and a Chriſtian, a Chriſtian heart makes over his will to God, now then if Gods will be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, for I have then no will of mine own, it is melted into the will of God, for ſo that is the excellency of grace, grace doth not only ſubject the will to God, but it doth melt the will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods will, ſo that they are now but one will; what a ſweet ſatisfaction muſt the ſoul have then in this condition, when all is made over to God; You will ſay this is hard? I will expreſs it a little more: A gracious heart muſt needs have ſatisfaction this way, becauſe godlineſſe doth teach him this, to ſee that his good is more in God then in himſelf, the good of my life, and comforts and my hapineſſe, and my glory, and my riches is more in God then it is in my ſelf; (that perhaps we may ſpeak too further, when we come to the leſſons that are to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:130622:30"/>
learned,) but upon this it is, that a gracious heart hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he doth melt his will into Gods, for ſaith he, if God have glory, I have glory, Gods glory is my glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods will is mine, if God have riches, then I have riches, if God be magnified, then I am magnified, if God be ſatisfied, then I am ſatisfied, Gods wiſdom and holineſſe is mine, and therefore his will muſt needs be mine, and my will muſt needs be his; here is the art of a Chriſtians Contentment, he melts his will into the will of God, and makes over his will to God, <hi>Oh Lord thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance for us. Pſal.</hi> 73.</p>
               <p>The Seventh thing, In the Art of Contentment is this, <hi>The Myſtery conſiſts not ſo much by bringing any thing without, to make my condition more comfortable, as to purge out ſomthing that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> The men of the world now, when they would have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and want any thing, Oh they muſt have ſomwhat from without to content them, but ſaith a godly man, let me get ſomthing out that is in already, and then I ſhall come to Contentment; As ſuppoſe a man hath an aguiſh humour that makes his drink taſte bitter, now ſaith he, You muſt put ſome ſugar into my drink, and his wife puts in ſome, and yet the drink taſtes bitter, Why? Becauſe the bitterneſſe comes from a bitter cholerick humour within; but let the Phyſitian come and give him a bitter potion to purge out the bitterneſſe that is within, and then he can taſte his drink well enough: Juſt thus it is with the men of the world, Oh ſuch a condition is bitter, and if I could have ſuch and ſuch a mercy added, to this mercy, then it would be ſweet; now if God ſhould put a ſpoonful or two of ſugar in, it would be bitter ſtill. But the way to Contentment is to purge out they luſts and bitter hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. <hi>Ja. 4. 1. From whence are wars, and ſtrifs, are they not from your luſts that are within you?</hi> they are not ſo much from things without, but from within; as ſomtimes I have ſaid, it is not all the ſtorms that are abroad that can make an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, but the vapours that are got within, and ſo if thoſe luſts that are within, in thy heart, if they were got out, thy condition would be a contented condition. Theſe are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious waies of godlineſſe, that the men of the world never think of; when dideſt thou ever think of ſuch a way as this is,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:130622:31"/>
for to go and purge out the diſtempers of thy heart that are within: Here are Seaven particulers now named, there were a great many more that I had thought of, and now without the underſtanding of theſe things, and the practice of them, you will never come to a true Contentation in your way, Oh you will be bunglers in this trade of Chriſtianity, but the right perceiving of theſe things, will help you to be inſtructed in it, as in a Myſtery.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Becauſe in what he hath, he hath the love of God,</hi> he hath Gods love to him in what he hath: If a King ſhould ſend a peice of meat from his own table, it is a great deal more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to a Courtier then if he had twenty diſhes at ordinary allowance, if the King ſend but any little thing and ſay, go and carry this to ſuch a man as a token of my love, Oh how delightful is that unto him? are your husbands at Sea and ſend you a token of their love, it is more then forty times ſo much that you have in your houſes already: Every good thing the people of God do injoy, they injoy it in Gods love; as a token of Gods love, and coming from Gods eternal love unto them, and this muſt needs be very ſweet unto them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>What they have it is ſanctified to them for good;</hi> Other men have what they injoy in a way of common providence, but the ſaints in a ſpeciall way: Others have what they have and there is all, they have meate, and drinke, and houſes, and cloathes, and money and that's all. But a gracious heart finds content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, I have it, and I have a ſanctified uſe of it too; I find God going along with what I have to draw my heart neerer to him, and ſanctifie my heart to him: If I find my heart drawn
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:130622:32"/>
nearer to God by what I injoy; it's more a great deal then if I have it without any ſanctifying of my heart by it; there's a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret dew that goes along with it, there's the dew of Gods love in it, and the dew of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A gracious heart what he hath he hath it upon free coſt, he is not like to be called to pay for what he hath:</hi> The difference between what a godly man hath, and a wicked man, is in this: A godly man is as a child in an Inne; an In<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>keeper hath his child in his houſe, and the Father provides his dyet, and lodging, and what is fit for him; Now there comes a ſtranger, and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath dinner and ſupper provided, and lodging but the ſtranger muſt pay for all; it may be the childs fare is meaner then the fare of the ſtranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſtranger hath boyld, and roſt and baked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he muſt pay for it, there muſt come a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for it. Iuſt thus it is, many of Gods people have but mean fare but God as a Father provides it, and it is on free coſt and they muſt not pay for what they have, it is paid for before; but the wicked in all their pomp, and pride, and bravery, they have what they call for, but there muſt come a reckoning for all, they muſt pay for all in the concluſion, and is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a little upon free coſt, then to come to have all to pay for? Grace doth ſhew a man that what he hath, he hath it on free coſt, from God as from a Father, and therefore muſt need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be very ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a godly man may very well be content, though he hath but little, <hi>for what he hath he hath it by right of Ieſus Chriſt, by the purchaſe of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he hath a right to it, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of right to what he hath, then any wicked man can have to what he hath; a wicked man hath theſe outward things; I doe not ſay they are uſurpers of what they have, but they have a right to it, and that before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, but how? it is a right by meer donation, that is God by his free bounty doth give it to them, but the right that the Saints have, it is a right of purchaſe, it is paid for, and it is their own, and they may in a holy manner, and holy way, challenge whatſoever they have need of. We cannot expreſſe the right of a holy man, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his right, and the right of the wicked more fully then by this ſimilitude; a Malefactor that is condemned to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:130622:32"/>
yet he hath by favourgranted to him his ſupper provided over night, and you cannot ſay though the Malefactor hath forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his right to all things, to every bit of bread, yet if he ſhall have a ſupper granted to him he doth not ſteale it, though all his right is forfeited by his fault, after he is once condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he hath no right to any thing; ſo it is with the wicked, they have forfeited all their right to all comforts in this world, they are condemned by God as Malefactors, and are going to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; but if God will in his bounty give them ſomething to preſerve them here in the world, they cannot be ſaid to be thieves or robbers: Now a man hath granted to him a ſupper overnight before his execution, but is that like the ſupper that he was wont to have in his own houſe, when he eat his own, bread, and had his wife and children about him? oh a diſh of green herbs at home would be a great deal better then any dainties in ſuch a ſupper as that is; but now a child of God hath not a right meerly by donation, but what he hath it is his own through the purchaſe of Chriſt; every bit of bread that thou eateſt, if thou beeſt a godly man or woman, Ieſus Chriſt hath bought it for thee, thou goeſt to market and buieſt thy meat and drink with thy money, but know that before thou haſt bought it, or paid money, Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of God the Father with his blood, thou haſt it at the hands of men for money, but Chriſt hath bought it at the hand of his Father by his blood: And certainly it is a great deale better and ſweeter now though it be but a little.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there's another thing that ſhews the ſweetneſſe that there is in that little that the Saints have by which they come to have contentment, whereas others cannot; that is, <hi>Every little that they have, it is but as an earneſt penny for all the glory that is reſerved for them, it is given them by God, but as the Fore-runner of thoſe eternall mercies that the Lord intends for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> now if a man hath but twelve pence given to him as an earneſt penny for ſome great poſſeſſion that he muſt have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is not that better then if he had forty pounds given unto him otherwiſe? So every comfort that the Saints have in this world, it is an earneſt penny to them of thoſe eternall mercies that the Lord hath provided for them; as every affliction that the the wicked have here it is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130622:33"/>
of ſorrows, and fore-runner of thoſe eternall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that they are like to have hereafter in Hell, ſo every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thou haſt is a fore-runner of thoſe eternall mercies thou ſhalt have with God in Heaven; not only the conſolations of Gods ſpirit are the fore-runners of thoſe eternall comforts thou ſhalt have in Heaven, but when thou ſitteſt at thy Table, and rejoyceſt with thy wife and children and friends, thou mayeſt look upon every one of thoſe but as a fore-runner, yea the very earneſt penny of eternall life unto thee. Now then if this be ſo, no marvail though a Chriſtian be contented; (this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie to the wicked) I have what I have out of the love of God, and I have it ſanctified to me by God, and I have it of free coſt from God by the purchaſe of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and I have it as a fore-runner of thoſe eternall mercies that are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for me; and in this my ſoul rejoyces, There's a ſecret dew of Gods goodneſſe, and bleſſing upon him in his eſtate that others have not; and by all this you may ſee the meaning of that Scripture, <hi>Prov. 16. 8. Better is a little with righteouſneſſe then great revenues without right;</hi> a man that hath but a little, yet if he hath it with righteouſneſſe, it is better then a great deale without right; yea, better then the great revenues of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; ſo you have it in another Scripture, that's the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in Chriſtian Contentment; the myſterie is in this, that he lives upon the dew of Gods bleſſing, in all the good things that he doth enjoy.</p>
               <p>The ninth thing wherein the myſterie of Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment conſiſt is this; <hi>Not only the good things that he hath, he hath the dew of Gods bleſſing in them, and they are very ſweet to him; but all the afflictions, all the evils that doe befall him he can ſee love in them all: And can enjoy the ſweetneſs of love in his afflictions as well, as in his mercies,</hi> yea the truth is the afflictions of Gods people comes from the ſame Eternall love that Jeſus Chriſt did come from. And that ſpeach of <hi>Ierom, he is a happy man that is beaten when the ſtroke is a ſtroke of love,</hi> all Gods ſtrokes are ſtrokes of love and mercy, all Gods wayes are mercy and truth, to thoſe that feare him and love him, <hi>Pſa. 25. 10. The wayes of God,</hi> the wayes of affliction, as well as the wayes of proſperity, are mercy and love to him. Grace gives a man an eye, a peircing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:130622:33"/>
eye to peirce into the counſells of God, thoſe Eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of God for good unto him, even in his afflictions, to ſee the love of God in every affliction as well as in proſperity. Now this is a myſtery to a carnall heart, they can ſee no ſuch thing, perhaps they thinke God loves them when he proſpers them and makes them rich, but they thinke God loves them not when he doth afflict them, that's a myſtery, but grace inſtructs men in that myſtery, grace inables men to ſee love in the very frownes of Gods face, and ſo comes to receive contentment.</p>
               <p>In the tenth place a Godly man hath contentment in the way of a myſtery, <hi>becauſe as he ſees all his afflictions come from the ſame love that Jeſus Chriſt did, So he ſees them all ſanctified in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſanctified in a Mediator;</hi> he ſees I ſay all the ſting and venom, and poyſon of them all to be taken out by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator between God and man: As now for inſtance, thus, a Chriſtian when he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment fals a working, what is my affliction? is it poverty that God ſtrikes me withall? Jeſus Chriſt had not a houſe to hide his head in, the Fowls of the ayr had neſts, and the Foxes had holes, but the Son of man not a hole to hide his head in: now my poverty is ſanctified by Chriſts poverty, I can ſee by faith the curſe and ſting and venom of my poverty, taken out by the poverty of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt Jeſus he was poor in this world to deliver me from the curſe of my poverty, that it ſhould not be curſed unto me then my poverty is not afflictive, if I can be contented in ſuch a condition. That is the way, not to ſtand and repine, becauſe I have not what others have, no but I am poor, and Chriſt was therefore poor that he might bleſſe my poverty to me.</p>
               <p>And ſo again, am I diſgraced, diſhonoured, is my good name taken away? why Jeſus Chriſt he had diſhonour put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and a Samaritan, and they ſaid he had a Devill in him, all the foul aſperſions that could be were caſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and this was for me, that I might have the diſgrace that is caſt upon me to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, whereas another man his heart is overwhelmed with diſhonours, and diſgrace, and he goes this way to work to get contentment, perhaps if you be ſpoken ill of, you have no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:130622:34"/>
otherway to eaſe and right your ſelves, but if they doe rail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, you will rail upon them again; and thus you thinke to eaſe your ſelves: Oh but a Chriſtian hath another manner of way to eaſe himſelfe, others rail and ſpeak ill of mee, but did they not rail upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpeak ill of him? and what am I in compariſon of Chriſt? And the ſubjection of Chriſt to ſuch an evill, it was for me, that though ſuch a thing ſhould come upon me, I might know that the curſe of it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me through Chriſts ſubjection to that evill; thus a Chriſtian can be contented when any body ſpeaks ill of him, now this is a myſterie to you to get contentment after ſuch a manner as this is; So if men jeer and ſcoffe at you, did they not do ſo to Ieſus Chriſt? they jeer'd and ſcoft at him, and that when he was in his greateſt extremity upon the Croſſe, ſay they, here's the King of the Jews, and they bowed the knee, and ſaid hail King of the Iews, and put a Reed into his hand, and mocked him: now I get Contentment in the midſt of ſcorns and jeers, by conſidering that Chriſt was ſcorned, and by acting faith upon that which Chriſt did ſuffer for me. So, am I in great pain of my body? Ieſus Chriſt had as great pain upon his body as I have, though its true hee had not ſuch kind of ſickneſſes as we have, but yet he had as great pain and torturs in his body, and that that was deadly to him, as wel as any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to us: the exerciſing of faith upon what Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that's the way to get Contentment in the midſt of our pains, one lies vexing and fretting, and cannot bare his pain, art thou a Chriſtian? haſt thou ever tryed this way of getting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to act thy faith upon all the pains and ſufferings that Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer, this would be the way of Contentment, and a Chriſtian gets Contentment under pains after this maner: ſometimes one that is very godly and gracious, you ſhall have them lie under grievous pains and extremities very cheerfully, and you wonder at it, this is the way that he gets it, he gets it by acting his faith upon what pains Ieſus Chriſt did ſuffer, thou art afraid of death, the way to get Contentment, it is by exerciſing thy faith upon the death of Ieſus Chriſt: yea, le may be thou haſt inward troubles in thy ſoule, and God with draws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from thee, but ſtill thy faith is to be exerciſed upon the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:130622:34"/>
ſufferings that Ieſus Chriſt indured in his ſoule, he poured forth his ſoule before God, then when he ſweat drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and blood, he was in an Agony in his very ſpirit, and he found even God himſelfe in a way to forſake him; now the acting thy faith upon Ieſus Chriſt thus, brings Contentment, and is not this a myſterie to carnall hearts? a gracious heart finds Contentment in a way of a myſterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no marvell though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am inſtructed in a Myſterie, to be contented in whatſoever condition I am in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the eleventh place, there is yet a further Myſterie (for this I hope you will find a verie uſefull point unto you) and you will ſee what a plaine way there is, (before we have done) for one that is skil'd in Religion to get contentment, though it's hard for one that is carnall. I ſay the eleventh myſtery in contentment is this <hi>A gracious heart hath contentment by fetching ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt, he is able to beare his burden by fetching ſtrength from auother,</hi> now this is a riddle indeede, and it would be a rediculous thing to be ſpoken of in the ſchooles of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, to ſay, if there be a burden upon you you muſt fetch ſtrength from another, indeed to have another to come and ſtand under the burden, that way they would know, but that you ſhall be ſtrengthned by anothers ſtrength, that is not neer you to your outward view, that they would thinke rediculous, but now a chriſtian finds ſatisfaction in every condition by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength from another, by going out of it's ſelfe to Jeſus Chriſt, and by faith acting upon Chriſt, and bringing the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt into it's own ſoul, and thereby is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to bear whatſoever God lays upon him, by the ſtrength that he finds from Jeſus Chriſt, of his fullneſs doe we receave grace for grace, there is ſtrength in Chriſt not onely to ſanctif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and ſave us, but ſtrength to ſupport us under all our burdens and afflictions, and Chriſt expects that when we are under any burden that we ſhould act our faith upon him to draw vertue and ſtrength from him, the acting of faith that's the great grace that is to be acted under afflictions, it's true other graces ſhould be acted, but the grace of faith it drawes ſtrength from Chriſt, in looking upon him that hath the fullnes of all ſtrength to be convayed into the hearts of all beleevers. Now
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:130622:35"/>
if a man hath a burden upon him, yet if he can have ſtrength added to him, if the burden be doubled, yet if he can have his ſtrength to be trebled, the burden will not be heavier but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then it was before to our naturall ſtrength. Indeed our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be heavie, and we cry out oh we cannot bear them, we cannot bear ſuch an affliction: Though thou canſt not tell how to bear it with thine owne ſtrength, yet what canſt thou tell what thou ſhalt doe with the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt? Thou ſaiſt thou canſt not bear it' why doeſt thou thinke that Chriſt could not bear it? if Chriſt could bear it why may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thou come to bear it? You will ſay can I have the ſtrength of Chriſt? Yea, that is made over to thee by faith, ſo the Scripture ſaith <hi>that the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> God himſelf is our ſtrength, and Chriſt is our ſtrength, divers ſcriptures we have that way; that Chriſts ſtrength is thine, made over to thee, that ſo thou mayeſt be able to bear whatſoever lies upon the, and therfore we find ſuch a ſtrange kind of expreſſion in the Epiſtle of ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Collo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Strengthned with all might, according to the power of God, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power of God, unto all patience, and long-ſuffering with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> you may not therefore be content with a litle ſtrength, ſo that you are able to bear what a man might bear by the ſtrength of reaſon and nature: But to be ſtrengthened with all might, according to the glorious power of God, unto all patience, and to all long-ſuffering; Oh you that are now under very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and ſad afflictions more then ordinary, look upon this Scripture, and conſider how this Scripture is made good in you, why may you not have this Scripture made good in you, if you be godly? You ſhould not be quiet in your own ſpirits, except that you in ſome meaſure do get this Scripture to be made good in you; ſo that you may with ſome comfort ſay, through Gods mercy I find that ſtrength coming in to me that is here ſpoken of in this Scripture.

                  </gap> it is by fetching in ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Another Myſtery, that there is in it, it is, <hi>That a godly heart, injoys much of God in every thing it hath, and doth know how to make up all wants in God himſelf,</hi> that is another My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, he hath God in what he hath, that I ſpoke too ſomwhat before, in ſhewing the dew of Gods bleſſing in what he hath, for God is able to let out a great deal of his power in little things, and therefore the miracles that God hath wrought, have been as much in little things as in great; now as God lets out a great deal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his power in working miracles in ſmaler things, ſo he lets out a great deal of goodneſſe and mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in comforting and rejoycing the hearts of his people in little things, as well as in great; there may be as much riches in a pearl as in a great deal of lumber; but now this is a diſtinct thing.</p>
               <p>Further, a gracious heart as he lives upon Gods dew in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he hath, ſo when that little that he hath ſhall be taken from him, what ſhall he do then?

himſelf, ſo as he ſhall injoy the quinreſence of the ſame good and comfort as he had before, for a godly man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he lives in God. This is now a Myſterie to a Carnal heart, I ſay a gracious man doth not live ſo much in himſelf as he doth in God, he lives in God continually; if there be any thing cut off from the ſtream, he knows how to go to the fountain, &amp; makes up all there; God is his all in all while he lives, I ſay tis God that is his all in all.

So here it may be, God had ſome ſtream of thy affection that ran to him then when thou dideſt injoy theſe things; Yea, but a great deal was let out to the Creature, a great deal of thy affections did run waſte, now the Lord would not have the affections of his Children to run waſt, hee doth not care for other mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for thine they are precious, and God would not have them to run waſte, therefore hath he cut off thy other pipes that thy heart might run wholly upon him: As if you have Children, becauſe you have ſervants perhaps do feed them and give them things, you perceive that your ſervants do ſteal away the hearts of your Children, you would hardly be able to bear it; you would be ready to turn away ſuch a ſervant, and when the ſervant is gone, the Child is at a great loſſe, it hath not the nurſe, but the father or mother intends by her putting away, that the affections of the Child might run the more ſtrongly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, or herſelf, and what loſſe hath the Child that the affections that run in a rough chanell before, towards the ſervant, it runs now towards the mother? So thoſe affections that runs towards the creature, God would have them run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, that ſo he may be All in All to thee here in this world: And a gracious heart can indeed tell how to injoy God to be All in All to him, that is the happineſſe of heaven to have God to be All in All: The Saints in heaven have not houſes, and lands, and money; and meat and drink, and cloaths, you will ſay, they do not need them, why do they not? It is becauſe God is All in All to them imediatly, now while thou liveſt in this world, thou mayeſt come to injoy much of God, you may have much of heaven, while we live in this life we may come to injoy much of the very life that there is in heaven, and what is that but the injoyment of God to be All in All to us: There is one text in the Revelations that ſpeaks of the glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church that is like to be even here in this world, <hi>Revel. 21. 22.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:130622:37"/>
all things in himſelf, and thou haſt God to be thine for thy portion, and in that thou haſt all, and this is the Myſtery of Contentment; It makes up all wants in God, this is that that the men of the world have little skill in.</p>
               <p>Now I have divers other things yet to open in the Myſtery of Contentment. I ſhould ſhew likwiſe that a godly man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes up all in God, but finds enough in himſelf to make up all, to make up all in himſelf, not from himſelf, but in himſelf, and that may ſeem to be ſtranger then the other, to make up all in God is ſomewhat, nay to make up all in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not from himſelf but in himſelf, that is, a gracious heart hath ſo much of God within himſelf, that he hath enough there to make up all his wants that are without. In <hi>Pro. 14. 14. A good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> from that that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, that is the meaning, a gracious man he hath a bird within his own boſom that makes him melody enough, though he wants muſick, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is within you,</hi> In <hi>Luke, 17. 21. He hath a Kingdom within him, and a Kingdom of God,</hi> you ſee him ſpoken ill of abroad, he hath a conſcience within him that makes up the want of a name and credit, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirtenth, <hi>A gracious heart fetches Contentment from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God hath made with him,</hi> Now this is a way of fetching contentment that the men of the world know not of; they can fetch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contentment, if they have the creature to ſatiſfie them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to fetch contentment from the Covenant of grace that they have little skill in: I ſhould here have opened two things, firſt, how to fetch contentment from the Covenant of grace in generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (but I ſhall ſpeak to that in the next ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and now onely a word to the ſecond) Secondly how he fetches contentment from the particular branches of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is, from the particular promiſes that he hath, for the ſupplying of every particular want; there is no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Godly man or woman can be in, but there is ſome promiſe or other in the ſcripture to help him in that condition. And that's the way of his contentment, to go out to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and fetch from the promiſe, that that may ſupply. But this is but a drie buſineſſe to a Carnall heart; but it's the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:130622:38"/>
moſt reall thing in the world to a gracious heart; when he finds want of Contentment he repaires to the promiſe, and the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and falls a pleading the promiſes that God hath made. As I ſhould have ſhewn ſeveral promiſes that God hath made let the affliction be what it will, I will but onely mention one, that is the ſaddeſt affliction of all; in caſe of the Viſitation, and the Plague. In <hi>Pſalme,</hi> 91. now thoſe that cannot have their friends come to them by reaſon of the plague, and that cannot have other comforts, in other afflictions they might have their friends and other things to comfort them, but in that they cannot, <hi>Pſal. 21. 10. There ſhall no evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling;</hi> then here is a promiſe for the peſtilence in the 5 and 6 verſes, this is a ſcripture to thoſe that are in danger of it, you will ſay this is a promiſe that the Plague ſhall not come nigh them, but mark theſe two are joyned, <hi>there ſhall no evill befall thee nether ſhall the plague come nigh thee,</hi> the <hi>evill of it</hi> ſhall not come nigh thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, it doth come to many godly men, and how can they make uſe of this Scripture, it is rather a Scripture that may trouble them, becauſe here's a promiſe that it ſhall not come nigh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet it doth come nigh them as well as others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, this is the Anſwer I would give, the promiſes of outward delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that were made to the people of God in the time of the law, were to be underſtood then a great deal more lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, &amp; fulfilled more litterally the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the times of the goſpel, God makes it up otherwiſe with as much mercy, though God made a covenant of grace &amp; eternal life in Chriſt with them, yet I think there was another Covenant too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God ſpeaks of as a diſtinct covenant for outward things, to deal with his people by according to their waies, either in outward proſperity, or in outward afflictions, more then now, in a more punctuall, ſet way, then in the times of the goſpel; and therefore when the Children of Iſrael did but ſin againſt God, they were ſure to have publique judgments to come upon them, and if they did well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alwaies publique mercies; the generall conſtant way of God was to deal with the people of the Jews acording as they did well or ill, (in an ordinary way), with outward judgments, and outward mercyes: but it's not ſo now in theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:130622:38"/>
times of the goſpell; we canot bring ſuch a certain concluſion, that if God did deal ſo ſeverely with men by ſuch and ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that he will deal ſo with them now: and ſo; that they ſhall have outward proſperitie as they had then, therefore that's the firſt thing, for the underſtanding of this, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther texts of that kind</p>
               <p>The Second Anſwer I would give is this, It may be their faith doth not reach to this promiſe, and God brings many times many outward afflictions, becauſe the faith of his people doth not reach the promiſe, and that not only in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in the times of the new Teſtament, <hi>Zachariah</hi> his time may be ſaid to be in the time of the new Teſtament, when he was ſtruck with dumbneſſe becauſe he did not beleeve, and that is given to be the cauſe why he was ſtruck with dumbneſſe. But you will ſay now, hath faith warant to beleeve deliverance, that it ſhall be fully delivered? I dare not ſay ſo, but it may act upon it, to beleeve that God will make it good his own way; perhaps you have not done ſo much, and ſo upon that, this promiſe is not fulfilled to you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when God doth make ſuch promiſes to his people, yet ſtill it muſt be with this reſervation, that God muſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That notwithſtanding his promiſe, he will have liberty to make uſe of any thing for your chaſtiſement.</item>
                  <item>2. That he muſt have liberty, to make uſe of your eſtates, or liberties, or lives, for the furtherance of his own ends: If it be to be a ſtumbling block to wicked and ungodly men; God muſt have liberty, though he have made a promiſe to you He will not looſe the propriety that he hath in your eſtates and lives.</item>
                  <item>3. God muſt have ſo much liberty to make uſe of what you have, for to ſhew that his waies are unſearchable, and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſt finding out, God reſerves theſe three things in his hand ſtill.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, what good then is there in ſuch a promiſe that God makes to his people?</p>
               <p>Firſt, That thou art under the protection of God more then others. But what comfort is this if it doth befall me?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:130622:39"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou haſt this comfort, that the evill of it ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thee, that if God will make uſe of this affliction for other ends, yet he will do it ſo as he will make it up to thee ſome other way. Perhaps you have given your children ſuch a thing, but yet afterwards if you have uſe of that thing, you will come and ſay, I muſt have it, why father may the child ſay you gave it me? But ſaith the father I muſt have it, and I will make it up to you ſome other way, Now the child doth not think that the fathers love is ever a whit the leſs to him. So when there is any ſuch promiſe as this is, that God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe gives thee his protection, and yet for all that ſuch a thing befalls thee, it is but as if the father ſhould ſay, I gave you that indeed, but let me have it and I will make it up to you ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way that ſhall be as good; ſaith God let me have your health and liberty, and life, and it ſhall be made up to you ſome other way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when ever the Plague or Peſtilence comes to thoſe that are under ſuch a promiſe, it is for ſome ſpecial and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, and God requires of them to ſearch and examin in a ſpeciall manner to find out his meaning; there is ſo much to be learned in the promiſe that God hath made concerning this particular evill, that the people of God they may come to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and content their hearts in this affliction. I reade in this Pſalme that God hath made promiſe to his people, to deliver them from the Plague and Peſtelence, and yet do I find it to come: It may be I have not made uſe of my faith in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe heretofore; and if God do bring afflictions upon me yet God will make it up ſome other way, God made a promiſe to deliver me, or at leaſt to deliver me from all the evill of it, now if this thing doth befall me and yet I have a promiſe of God, certainly the evill of it is taken away, this promiſe tels me that if it doth befall me yet it is for ſome notable end, and becauſe God hath uſe of my life, and intends to fetch about his glory ſome way that I know not of: And if he will come in a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of chaſtiſement, yet I will be ſatisfied in the thing: So a Chriſtian heart by reaſoning out of the word, comes to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſoul in the middeſt of ſuch a heavy hand of God, and in ſuch a diſtreſſed condition as that is: Now Carnal hearts they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:130622:39"/>
find not that power in the word, that healing vertue that there is in the word, to heal their diſtracted cares, and the troubles of their ſpirits, but now thoſe that are godly when they come to hear the word they find out that in the word, there is as a plaiſter to all their wounds, and ſo they come to have eaſe and Contentment, in ſuch conditions as are very greiveous and miſerable unto others. But now for other particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and more generally for the Covenant of grace, how and in what myſterious way the Saints do work to fetch out Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction to their ſouls, we ſhall refer to the next time.</p>

               <p>That's the next then, a Chriſtian heart hath not only Contentment in God, and certainly he that hath God muſt have all, he that hath him that hath all he hath all; <hi>But he is able to make up all his outward wants of creature comforts from what he finds in himſelfe.</hi> That may ſeem to be more ſtrange, It's true perhaps we may convince men though they doe not feel by experience what it is to make up all in God, yet we may convince them that if we have him that hath all things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they have all, for there is ſuch a fulneſſe in God, he being the infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite firſt being of all things that may make up all their wants.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:130622:40"/>
But here's another thing that's further, I ſay a godly man can make up whatſoever he wants without the creature, he can make it up in himſelfe, in the 14. of the <hi>Prov. 14. A good man is ſatisfied in himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as now, If he wants outward comforts, good chear, feaſting, a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt, he can make up the want of a feaſt by that peace he hath in his own conſcience; if he wants melody abroad, he hath a bird within him that ſings the moſt melodious ſongs that are in the world? and the moſt delightfull. And then doth he want ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he hath his own conſcience witneſſing for him, that is as a thouſand witneſſes, the Scripture ſaith in the 17. of <hi>Luke, v. 21. Neither ſhall they ſay lo here, or lo there, for behold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is within you;</hi> a Chriſtian then whatſoever he wants he can make it up, for he hath a Kingdom in himſelf, the Kingdom of God is within you. If one that is a King ſhould meet with a great deal of trouble when he is abroad, yet hee Contents himſelfe with this, I have a Kingdom of mine own; now here it's ſaid the Kingdom of God is within a man; truly, upon this Scripture of the Kingdom of God being within, thoſe that are learned if they would but look into that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Goſpel that we have of a learned man, they ſhall find a very ſtrange conceit that he hath about this very text, he confeſſes indeed it is unutterable, and ſo indeed it is, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you, he makes it that there is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God and Chriſt within the ſoul of a man, that when the body dies, he ſaith, that the ſoul goes into God and Chriſt that is within him, the ſouls going into God and Chriſt, and enjoying of that Communion with God and Chriſt that is within its ſelfe, that's Heaven to it (ſaith he) he confeſſes he is not able to expreſſe himſelfe, nor others cannot underſtand fully what he intends; but certainly for the preſent before death, there's a Kingdom of God within the ſoul, ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God in the ſoul that is enough to Content the heart of any godly man in the world, the Kingdom that he hath now within him, he ſhall not ſtay till afterwards, till he goes to Heaven, but certainly there is a Heaven in the Soul of a godly man, he hath Heaven already; many times when you goe to comfort your friends in their afflictions, you will ſay
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:130622:40"/>
Heaven will pay for all; nay, you may certainly find Heaven pays for all already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a Heaven within the Souls of the Saints, that's a certain truth, no ſoul ſhall ever come to heaven, but that Soul that hath Heaven come to it firſt. When you die you hope you ſhall goe to Heaven: But if you ſhall goe to Heaven when you die, Heaven will come to you before you die. Now this is a great Myſterie to have the Kingdom of Heaven in the Soul, no man can know this but that Soul that hath it, that Heaven which is within the Soul for the preſent (I ſay) it is like the white ſtone and the new name, that none but thoſe that have it can underſtand it: It's a miſerable condition my brethren to depend upon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures altogether for our Contentment, you know that rich men account it a great happineſſe, if they need not go to buy things by the penny as others do, they have all things for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit upon their own ground, and all their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance lyes intire together, they have no body comes within them, but they have all within themſelves, there lyes their happineſſe: Whereas other poorer people are fain to go from one Market to another to provide them neceſſaries, but yet great rich men they have ſheep and beeves, corn and cloathing, and all things elſe of their own within themſelves, and herein they place their happineſſe: But this is the happineſſe of a Chriſtian, that he hath that within himſelfe that may ſatisfie him more then all theſe; That place that we have in the firſt of <hi>James</hi> ſeems to allude to that condition of men that have all their eſtates within themſelves, <hi>Iam. 1. 4. But let patience have her perfect work that we may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing,</hi> the word there uſed ſignifies to have the whole inheritance to our ſelves, not a broken inheritance, but that where all lyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, as a man that hath not a piece of his eſtate here, and a piece there, but he hath it all lye together, and the heart being patient under afflictions finds it ſelfe to be in ſuch an eſtate as this is, finds his whole inheritance to be together, and all intire within its ſelfe. And now ſtill to ſhew this by further ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, it is with him being fild with good things, juſt like as it is with many a man that enjoys abundance of comforts at home, at his own houſe, God grants to him a convenient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:130622:41"/>
a comfortable yoke fellow, and fine walks and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and hath all things at home that he could deſire; now this man cares not much for going abroad, other men are fain to go abroad to take the ayr, but he hath a ſweet ayr at home, and they are fain to go abroad to ſee friends, becauſe they have raylings and contendings at home; many ill husbands will give this reaſon, (if his wife make any moan, and complaint of his ill husbandry) of their bad husbandry, and will make that their excuſe to go abroad, becauſe they can never be quiet at home. Now we account thoſe men moſt happy that have all at home; thoſe that have cloſe houſes that are unſavory, and ſmels ill, they delight to go into the freſh ayr, I but it is not ſo with many others that have theſe at home; thoſe that have no good chear at home, they are fain to go abroad to friends, but thoſe that have their Tables furniſhed, they had as live ſtay at home; ſo a carnall man he hath but little Contentment in his own ſpirit, it's <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſimilitude (ſaith he) an ill conſcience is like a ſcoulding wife, a man (ſaith he) that hath an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he cares not to look into his own ſoul, but loves to be abroad, and look into other things, but never looks to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but one that hath a good conſcience he delights in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his own heart, he hath a good conſcience within him, and ſo a carnall heart, becauſe there's nothing but filthineſſe, a filthy ſtinke in himſelfe, nothing but vildneſſe and baſeneſſe within him; upon this it is that he ſeeks his Contentment elſe where: And as it is with a veſſel that's full of liquor, if you ſtrike upon it it will make no great noyſe, but if it be empty then it makes a great noiſe; ſo it is with the heart, a heart that is full of grace and goodneſſe within, ſuch a one will bear a great many ſtrokes, and never make any noiſe, but an empty heart if that be ſtruck that will make a noiſe, thoſe men and women that are ſo much complayning, and always whyning, it is a ſign that there's an emptineſſe in their hearts, but if their hearts were filled with grace they would not make ſuch an noiſe as now they do. As a man that hath his bones fill'd with marrow, and veins fill'd with good blood, he complains not of cold as others do; ſo a gracious heart having the ſpirit of God within him, and his heart fill'd with Grace, he hath that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:130622:41"/>
within him that makes him find Contentment. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Seneca,</hi> Indeed thoſe things that I ſuffer will be incredibly heavy when I cannot bear my ſelfe; but now if I be no burden to my ſelfe, if I have all quiet within in mine own heart, then I can bear any thing, many men through their wickedneſſe they have burdens without, but the greateſt burden is the wickedneſſe of their own hearts, they are not burdened with their ſins in a godly way, that would eaſe their burden, but they have ſtill their wickedneſſe in the power of it, and ſo they are burdens to themſelves. The diſtempers of mens hearts are mighty bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to them, many times a godly man hath enough within to Content him; Vertue it is Content with its ſelfe, for to live well; (It's a ſpeech of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and it's in one of his Paradoxes) it finds enough within its own ſphere for the living happily, but how few are acquainted with this Myſterie? Many think O if I had that that another man hath, how happily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſhould I live, Oh but if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy condition be, yet thou haſt enough within thy ſelfe, you will ſay ſuch and ſuch men that have all things they need not be beholding to any body, you ſhall have many that will labour and take pains when they are young, that they might not be beholding to others, I love to live of my ſelfe; now a Chriſtian may do ſo, not that he doth not live upon God; (I mean not ſo) but upon that that he hath of God within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he can live upon, although he doth not enjoy the comforts that are without himſelfe, that's it which I mean, and thoſe that are godly and keep cloſe to God in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, they underſtand what I mean by this, that a Chriſtian hath ſupply of all his wants within himſelfe; and here you may ſee that the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is a precious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a godly ſpirit is precious, why? becauſe it hath enough to make him happy within himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The next thing that the Myſterie of Contentment conſiſts in is this, <hi>That a gracious heart fetches ſupply of all from the Covenant, and ſo comes to have Contentment,</hi> which is a dry thing to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit: Now there are two things here.</p>
               <p>Firſt he fetches Contentment from the Covenant in General, that is from the great Covenant that God hath made with him in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:130622:42"/>Secondly, from the particular promiſes that God hath made with him in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt from the Covenant in generall, Ile give you one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that, it's very remarkable, in the ſecond of <hi>Sam. 23. verſ. 5. Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow,</hi> it's a moſt admirable Scripture of <hi>David</hi> that yet had not the Covenant of Grace opened ſo fully as we have. But yet mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Although I find not my houſe ſo, that is, ſo comfortably every way as I would, although it be not ſo, what hath he to content his ſpirit? ſaith he, he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, this is that that helps all; I am not (may ſome men ſay) thus and thus with God, I do not find God come in ſo fully, or it's not with my houſe and family as I hoped it might be, perhaps there is this or that affliction upon my houſe; ſuppoſe you ſhould have the plague come into your houſe, and your houſe is not ſo ſafe, and you have not that outward comfort in your houſe as formerly you have had, but can you read this Scripture, and ſay, although my houſe be not ſo bleſt with health as other mens houſes are, although my houſe be not ſo, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; I am one yet in Covenant with God, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant; as for theſe things in this world I ſee they are but momentany, they are not everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, I ſee in a Family when all was well but a week agoe, now all is down, and the plague hath ſwept away a great many of them, and the reſt are left in ſadneſſe and mourning; we ſee there is no reſting in the things of this world, yet the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I find diſorder in my heart, in my family; but the everlaſting Covenant that's ordered in all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and that's ſure, alack there's no ſureneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e here in theſe things: I can be ſure of nothing here, eſpecially in theſe times, we know that a man can be ſure of little that he hath, who can be ſure of his eſtate? perhaps ſome of you here that have liv'd well and comfortably before, and all was well about you, and you thought your Mountain was ſtrong, but you ſee within a day or two all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130622:42"/>
away from you, ſo that there is no ſureneſſe in the things of this world: But ſaith he the Covenant is ſure, what I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Sea that's not ſure but here's an aſſurance Office indeed, here's a great aſſurance Office for the Saints, and they are not at charge, but only the exerciſing of Grace, for they may goe to this Aſſurance Office to aſſure every thing that they venture, either to have the thing it ſelfe, or be paid for it: In an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Office you cannot be aſſured to have the very goods come in that you inſured, but if they be loſt the Inſurers do ingage themſelves to make it good to you. And this Covenant of grace that God hath made with his people, it is Gods aſſurance Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Saints in all their fears may and ought to go to the Covenant to aſſure all things to them, to aſſure their eſtates and aſſure their lives. You will ſay how are they ſure, their lives and eſtates goe as well as others? But God ingages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make up all: And then mark what follows, <hi>This is all my Salvation,</hi> Why <hi>Dauid</hi> wilt thou not have ſalvation from thine enemies and outward dangers, from peſtilence and plague? The frame of his ſpirit is quieted, as if he ſhould ſay; if that Salvation comes well and good, I ſhall praiſe God for it, but that that I have in the Covenant that's my ſalvation, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that as enough: Yea and then further, <hi>This is all my Salvation and all my deſire,</hi> Why <hi>David</hi> is there not ſomething elſe that thou wouldeſt have beſides this Covenant? No ſaith he, it is all involved in this. Now ſurely thoſe men or women muſt needs live contented lives that have all their deſires, now ſaith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man here, this is all my deſire, <hi>And though he make it not to grow.</hi> But for all this Covenant perhaps you will not proſper in the world as other men do, true, but I am at a point for that: Though God doth not make my houſe to grow, I have all my deſires.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how a godly heart finds contentment in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, many of you ſpeak of the Covenant of God, and of the Covenant of grace, but have you found it ſo effectual to your ſouls, have you ſuckt this ſweetneſſe from the Covenant and content to your hearts in your ſad conditions? It's a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſign of the truth of grace in any ſoul, that when any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth befall him, in a kind of natural way he doth preſently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:130622:43"/>
repair to the Covenant, juſt as a Child as ſoon as ever is is in danger, you ſhall not need to tell him and ſay when you are in danger you muſt go to your father or mother, why nature tells him ſo; ſo it is with a gracious heart, as ſoon as it is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble or affliction there is a new nature that doth cary him to the Covenant preſently, and there it finds eaſe and reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if you find that your hearts do thus work, preſently to be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant, it is an excellent ſign of the truth of grace: that's for the general.</p>
               <p>But now for particular promiſes in the covenant of grace. A gracious heart looks upon every promiſe as coming from the root of the great covenant, of grace in Chriſt. Other men look upon ſome particular promiſes, that God will helpe them in ſtraits, and keepe them and the like; but they look not upon the conection of ſuch particular promiſes, to the root, the Covenant of grace: Now Chriſtians doe miſſe of a great deale of comfort they might have, from the particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the goſpel, if they'd look upon their conectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the root, the great Covenant that God hath made with them in Chriſt. Now I remember I ſpoke a little about that, that in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſes in the times of the law, they might reſt more upon them then we can in the time of the goſpel. I gave you the reaſon why we that live in the times of the goſpel canot reſt ſo fully, for a litteral performance of outward promiſes that we meet withall in the old Teſtament, as they might in the time of the law: for there was a ſpecial covenant, that God pleaſed to call a New Covenant by way of diſtinction from the other covenant that is made with us in Chriſt for eternall life: and ſo even the law was given to them in a more peculiar way for an external covenant of outward bleſſings in the land of Canaan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo God did deale with them in a more external covenant then he doth now with his people. Yet godlyneſſe, hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come. We may make uſe of the promiſes for this life, but yet not ſo much to reſt upon the litteral performance of them as they might; but that God will make them good ſome way or other, in a ſpiritual way if not in an outward way. We muſt lay no more upon outward promiſes then this, and therefore if we will lay
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:130622:43"/>
more, we make the promiſe to bear more then it will bear out. For to give ſome inſtance; to beleeve fully and confidently, that the Plague ſhall not come nigh ſuch a houſe, (I ſay) it is to lay more upon ſuch a promiſe then it will bear. I opened that promiſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. now if I had lived in the time of the Law, perhaps I might have been ſomewhat more confident of the litterall performance of the promiſe, then I can now in the time of the goſpel; the promiſe now bears no more then this, that God hath a ſpecial protection over his people, and that he will deliver them from the evil of ſuch an affliction; and if he doth bring ſuch an affliction it is more then an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary providence, it is ſome ſpecial providence that God hath in it. I had thought to have given you divers promiſes for the contentment of the heart in the time of affliction. <hi>Iſa. 43. 2. When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall not over-flow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee;</hi> certainly though this promiſe was made in the time of the Law, yet it will be made good to all the Saints now, one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in the letter or ſome other waies. For ſo we find it plainly, that promiſe that was made to <hi>Joſhua, I will not fail thee nor forſake thee, Joſh.</hi> 1. 5. It's applied to the Chriſtians in the time of the Goſpel. So that here is the way of faith in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contentment by the promiſes, that all the promiſes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were made to our forefathers, from the begining of the world, the Saints of God have an intreſt in them, they are their inheritances, and ſo goes on from one generation to another, and by that they come to have Contentment, becauſe they do inherit all the promiſes made in all the book of God, So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. ſhews plainly, that it is our inheritance, and we do not inherit leſs now then they did in <hi>Joſhuas</hi> time, but we inherit more; for you ſhall find in that place of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> there is more ſaid then is to <hi>Joſhua;</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> God ſaith, He will not leave him nor forſake him; now in that place in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> there's five negatives, I will not, not, not not, not again, there is the elegancy of it very much, in the <hi>Greek</hi> (I ſay) there is five negatives in that little ſentence; as if God ſhould ſay, I will not leave you, no I will not, I will not, I will not,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:130622:44"/>
with ſuch earneſtneſſe five times together: So that we have not only the ſame promiſes that they had, but we have them more inlarged and more full, though ſtill not ſo much in the litteral ſenſe, for that indeed is the leaſt part of the promiſe, In <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54. 17. there God made a promiſe, <hi>That no weapon formed againſt his people ſhould proſper, and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt them in judgement thou ſhalt condemne,</hi> (and mark what follows) <hi>This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſs is of me ſaith the Lord,</hi> this is a good promiſe for a ſouldier, though ſtill not to lay too much upon the litteral ſenſe: True it holds forth thus much, that Gods protection is in a ſpeciall maner over ſouldiers that are godly, <hi>And every tongue that ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee in judgement thou ſhalt condemne,</hi> and this is againſt falſe witneſſe too: Oh you, that your friends never left you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, you will ſay my friends dyed and left not me a groat, but I thank God, God hath provided for me; But though thy father or mother dyed and left thee no heritage, yet thou haſt a heritage in the promiſe, <hi>This is their heritage.</hi> So that there's no godly man or woman, but is a great heir. Therefore when thou lookeſt into the book of God and findeſt any promiſe there, thou mayeſt make that thine own. Juſt as an heir that rides over divers fields and meadows, ſaith he this meadow is my heritage, and this corne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>field is my heritage; and then he ſees a fair houſe, and ſaith he, this fair houſe is my heritage; and he looks upon them with another maner of eye then a ſtranger that ſhall ride over thoſe fields. So a carnall heart reads the promiſes, and reads them but meerly as ſtories, not that they have any great intreſt in them: But a godly man eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he reads the Scriptures (remember this note when you are reading the Scripture) and there meeteth with a promiſe, he ought to lay his hand upon it and ſay, this is a part of my heritage, it's mine, and I am to live upon it, and this will make you to be Contented. Here's a myſterious way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. &amp; 37. 6. there's divers other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that brings Contentment. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 10. And thus much for the Myſterie of Contentment by way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>There is two or three things more that ſhew how a godly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:130622:44"/>
man, hath Contentment after another kind of way then any Carnall heart in the world hath, it's a myſterious way, as thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath Contentment by realizing the glorious things of heaven to him,</hi> he hath the kingdom of heaven as preſent, and the glory that is to come, by faith he makes it as preſent. So the Martirs they had Contentment in their ſufferings, for ſaid ſome of them, though we have but a hard breakfaſt, yet we ſhall have a good dinner, we ſhall preſently be in heaven; do but ſhut your eyes (ſaith one) and you ſhall be in heaven preſently. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. We faint not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) Why? <hi>Becauſe theſe light afflictions that are but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory.</hi> They ſee heaven before them and that contents them. You marriners when you can ſee the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before you, though you were mightily troubled before you could ſee any land, yet when you come nigh the ſhore and can ſee ſuch a land-mark, that contents you exceedingly: a godly man in the middeſt of the waves and ſtormes that he meets withall, he can ſee the glory of heaven before him and ſo contents himſelf; one drop of the ſweetneſſe of heaven is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take away all the ſower and bitter of all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world: Indeed here we know that one drop of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or one drop of gall will make bitter a great deal of honey; put a ſpoonfull of ſugar into a cup of gall or wormwood, that will not ſweeten it, but if you put a ſpoonfull of gall into a cup of ſugar it will imbitter that; now it's otherwiſe in heaven, one drop of ſweet will ſweeten a great deal of ſower affliction, but a great deal of ſower and gall will not imbitter a ſoul that ſees the glory of heaven that is to come, now a Carnall heart hath no Contentment but from what he ſees before him in this world, but a godly heart hath Contentment from that that he ſees laid up for him in the higheſt heavens.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I would name is this, <hi>A godly man hath Contentment by opening and letting out of his heart to God,</hi> other men or women they are diſcontented, but how do they help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? by rayling, by ill language, ſuch a one croſſes them, and they have no way to help themſelves but by railing and by bitter words, and ſo they eaſe themſelves that way when they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:130622:45"/>
are angry, but a godly man when he is croſt how doth he eaſe himſelf? he is ſenſible of his croſſe as well as you, and he goes to God in prayer, and there opens his heart to God, and lets out his ſorrows and fears, and then can come away with a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance; now do you find that you can come away from prayer and not look ſad? As it's ſaid in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18 of <hi>Hannah,</hi> that when ſhee had been at prayer her countenance was no more ſad, there ſhee was comforted, and this is the right way of Contentment. Thus we have done with the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Contentment. Now if you can but put theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we have ſpoken of, you may ſee fully what an Art Chriſtian Contentment is, <hi>Paul</hi> had need learn it; you ſee Contentment is not ſuch a poor buſineſſe as many make it, to ſay you muſt be content &amp;c. But it is a great Art and Myſterie of godlineſſe to be contented in the way of a Chriſtian, and it will appear yet further to be a myſterie when we come to the third head; and that's to ſhew what thoſe leſſons are that a gracious heart doth learn when it learns to be Contented. I have learned to be Contented, <hi>Learned,</hi> what leſſons have you learned? As now a Scholer that hath great learning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in Arts and Sciences, how did he begin it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (as we uſe to ſay) his A B C, and then afterwards he came to his Teſtament, and Bible, and Accidence, and ſo to his Gramar, and afterwards to his other books; ſo he learn'd one thing after another: So a Chriſtian coming to Contentment is as a Scholer in Chriſts School, and there are divers leſſons to teach the Soul to bring it to this learning, every godly man or woman is a ſcholer, it cannot be ſaid of any Chriſtian that he is illiterate, but he is litterate, a learned man, a learned woman, now the leſſons that Chriſt teaches to bring us to Contentment are theſe.</p>
               <p>The Firſt great leſſon is, <hi>The leſſon of ſelf-deniall,</hi> and though it be a great leſſon and hard, as you know a Child at firſt cries it's hard. It's that that I remember <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever hath not learned the leſſon of the croſſe, hath not learned his A B C in Chriſtianity,</hi> here Chriſt begins with his ſcholers, yea thoſe in the loweſt forme muſt begin with this; if you mean to be Chriſtians at all, you muſt buckle to this or you can never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:130622:45"/>
be Chriſtians: There is none can be a Scholer except he doth learn his A B C, ſo thou muſt learn the leſſon of ſelf-deniall or thou canſt never come to be a Scholer in Chriſts School, to be learned in this myſtery of Contentment: That's the firſt leſſon that Chriſt teaches any ſoul; Oh ſelf-deniall that brings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that brings down and ſoftens a mans heart; a thing (you know) that's ſoft if you ſtrike upon it it makes no noiſe, but if you ſtrike upon a hard thing it makes a noiſe, ſo the hearts of men that are full of themſelves, and hardened with ſelf-love, if they have any ſtroak they make a noiſe, but a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying Chriſtian yeilds to Gods hand, and makes no noiſe; as when you ſtrike upon a woolſack it makes no noiſe becauſe it yealds to the ſtroke. So a ſelf-denying heart yeilds to the ſtroke and thereby comes to this Contentment. Now in this leſſon of ſelf-denial there are divers things, I will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doctrine of ſelf-deniall, but only ſhew you how Chriſt teaches ſelf-deniall and how that brings Contentment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such a one learns to know that he is nothing,</hi> he comes to this, to be able to ſay, well I ſee I am nothing in my ſelf, now that man or woman which indeed knows that he or ſhe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and hath learned it throughly will be able to bear any thing: The way to be able to bear any thing, it is to know our ſelves to be nothing in our ſelves. Saith God to us, <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which is nothing? Pro.</hi> 23. 5. ſpeaking of riches; Why bleſſed God doeſt not thou do ſo, thou haſt ſet thy heart upon us and yet we are nothing. God would not have us ſet our hearts upon riches becauſe they are nothing, and yet God is pleaſed to ſet his heart upon us, and yet we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that's Gods grace, free grace, and therefore it's no great matter what I ſuffer for I am as nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I deſerve nothing,</hi> I am nothing, and I deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſuppoſe I have not this and that that others have, I am ſure I deſerve nothing except it be hell, you will anſwer any of your ſervants ſo that is not content, I marvail what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? or your Children, do you deſerve it that you are ſo eager upon it? you think to ſtop their mouthes thus, ſo we may eaſily ſtop our own mouthes, we deſerve nothing and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we be impatient if we have not what we deſire,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:130622:46"/>
if we had deſerved any thing, we might have ſome trouble of ſpirit, as a man that hath deſerved well of the State, or of his friends and he finds not an anſwerable incouragement, it troubles him mightily, but if he be concious to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſelf that he hath deſerved nothing he is content with a repulſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I can do nothing, without me you can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. why ſhould I ſtand much upon it to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſcontented if I have not this and that, when the truth is I can do nothing? If you ſhould come to one that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery becauſe he hath not ſuch dyet as he deſires, and is diſcont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, you will anſwer him, I mervail what you doe, what uſe you are of? Shall one that will ſit ſtill and be of no uſe, yet for all that he muſt have all the ſupply that poſſibly he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Do but conſider of what uſe you are in the world; if you conſider what little need God hath of you, and what little uſe you are of, you will not be much diſcontented: If you have learned this leſſon of ſelf-deniall, though God doth cut you ſhort of ſuch and ſuch comforts, yet ſince that I do but little why ſhould I have much, this very thought will bring down a mans ſpitit as much as any thing, That's the Third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>So vild I am that I can receive no good neither of my ſelf,</hi> I am not only an empty veſſel, but a corrupt and unclean veſſell that would ſpoil any thing that comes into it, ſo are all our hearts, every one of our hearts is not only empty of good but are like a muſtie veſſel that if any good licquor be powred into it it ſpoils it, And that's the Fourth thing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If God doth cleanſe us in ſome meaſure, and doth put into us ſome good licquor ſome grace of his Spirit, yet in the <hi>fifth place, we can make uſe of nothing neither when we have it, if God doth but withdraw himſelf,;</hi> If God doth but leave us one moment after he hath beſtowed upon us the greateſt gifts, and whatſoever abilities we can deſire, if God ſhould ſay I will give you them, now go and trade now I have given you theſe and theſe abilities, we cannot ſtir one foot further neither if God doth but leave us. Doth God give us gifts and parts? Then let us fear and tremble leaſt God ſhould leave us to our ſelves, for then how foully ſhould we abuſe thoſe gifts &amp; parts, you think other men and women have memorie and gifts and parts and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:130622:46"/>
you would fain have them, But ſuppoſe God ſhould give you theſe and there leave you, you would utterly ſpoile them.</p>
               <p>Sixly, <hi>We are worſe then nothing,</hi> for by ſin we come to be a great deal worſe then nothing, ſin makes us more vild then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſin makes us contrary to all good, now it's a great deal worſe to have a contrariety to all that is good then meerly to have an emptineſs of all that is good, we are not empty pitchers in reſpect of good, but we are like pitchers fill'd with poiſon, and is it much for ſuch as we are to be cut ſhort of outward comforts.</p>
               <p>In the Seventh place, <hi>If we periſh there will be no loſs of us,</hi> If God ſhould anihilate me what loſs would there be of me? God can raiſe up an other in my place to do him other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then I have done, Now put but theſe ſeven things together and then hath Chriſt taught you Self-denial: I may call theſe the ſeveral words in our leſſon of Self-denial; Chriſt teaches the ſoul this, ſo that as in the preſence of God upon a real ſight of its ſelf it can ſay, Lord I am nothing, Lord I deſerve nothing, Lord I can do nothing, I can receive nothing, and can make uſe of nothing, I am worſe then nothing, and if I come to nothing and periſh' there will be no loſſe at all of me, and therefore what great matter is it for me to be cut ſhort here? A man that is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his own eyes, ſuch a man or woman will account every affliction to be little, and every mercy to be great. <hi>Saul,</hi> There was a time (the Scripture ſaith) that he was little in his own eyes, and then his afflictions were but little to him, when ſome would not have had him to be King but ſpake contemptuouſly of him he held his peace, but when <hi>Saul</hi> began to be big in his own eyes, then the affliction began to be great upon him. <hi>There was never any ſuch contented man or woman as this ſelf-denying man or woman;</hi> There was never any denied himſelf ſo much as Jeſus Chriſt did, he gave his cheeks to the ſmiters, he opened not his mouth, he was as a lamb when he was led to the ſlaughter, he made no noiſe in the ſtreet, Oh he denyed himſelf above all, and was willing to empty himſelfe, and ſo he was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that ever any was in the world, &amp; the neerer we come to learn to deny our ſelves as Chriſt did, the more contented ſhall we be, &amp; by knowing much of out own vileneſſe we come to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:130622:47"/>
learn to juſtifie God, whatever the Lord ſhall lay upon us yet righteous is the Lord for he hath to deal with a moſt wretched creature. A diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted heart he is troubled becauſe he hath no more comfort, but one that is a ſelf-denying man he rather wonders that he hath ſo much as he hath: Oh ſaith one I have but a little, I but ſaith he that hath learn'd this leſſon of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall, I rather wonder that God beſtows upon me the liberty of breathing in the Aire, knowing how vild I am, and knowing how much ſin the Lord doth ſee in me: And that's the way of Contentment by learning Self-denial.</p>
               <p>Eightly, There is a further thing in Self-denial which brings Contentment, <hi>Becauſe thereby the Soul comes to rejoyce and take ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in all Gods waies,</hi> (I beſeech you obſerve this) If a man be ſelviſh and have Self-love prevail in his heart, thoſe things that ſuits with his own ends he will be glad of them, but a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man that hath denied himſelfe he will ſuit with and be glad of all things that ſhall ſuit with Gods ends: Saith a gracious heart, Gods ends are my ends, and I have denied mine own ends, and ſo he comes to find Contentment in all Gods ends and waies, and his comforts are multiplyed, whereas the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of other men are ſingle, it's but very rare that Gods waies ſhall ſuite with a mans particular end, but alwaies Gods waies ſuit with his own ends, now if you will only have contentment when Gods waies ſuits with your own ends, you can have it but now and then, but a Self-denying man denies his own ends and only looks at the ends of God and therein is contented: When a man is ſelviſh he cannot but have a great deal of trouble and vexation, for if I regard my ſelf, my ends are ſo narrow that I ſhall have a hundered things will come and juſſel me, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have rome in thoſe narrow ends of mine own; as you know in the City what a deal of ſtir there is in narrow ſtreets, as Thames ſtreet being ſo narrow they juſſel and wrangle and fight one with another becauſe the place is ſo narrow, but now in the broad ſtreets there they can go quietly, ſo men that are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh they meet and ſo juſſel one with another, one man is for ſelf in one thing, and another man is for ſelf in another thing, and ſo they make a great deal of ſtir, but thoſe whoſe hearts are inlarged and make publike things their ends, and can deny
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:130622:47"/>
themſelves, they can walke at breadth and never juſſel one with another ſo as the other doe. The leſſon of Self-denial is the firſt leſſon that Jeſus Chriſt doth learn men in the ſeeking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</p>
               <p>The Second leſſon <hi>Is the vanity of the Creature,</hi> That's the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leſſon in Chriſts School that he teaches thoſe that he would make ſcholers in this Art: The vanity of the Creature, that whatſoever there is in the Creature hath an emptineſſe in it <hi>Vanity of vanities all is vanity,</hi> that's the leſſon that the wiſe man learn'd, that the Creature in it's ſelf can do us neither good nor hurt, but it is all but as wind, there is nothing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ſuitable to a gracious heart to feed upon for the good and happineſſe of it: My brethren the reaſon why you have not Contentment in the things of the world, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not enough of them, that's not the reaſon, but the reaſon is becauſe they are not things proportionable to that immortal ſoul of yours that are capeable of God himſelf, many men think when they are troubled and have not Contentment that it is becauſe they have but a little in the world, and if they had more then they ſhould be content. That were juſt thus, ſuppoſe a man is an hungrie, and to ſatisfie his craving ſtomak he ſhould gape and hold open his mouth to take in the wind, and then ſhould think the reaſon why he is not ſatisfied is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not enough of the wind, no, the reaſon is becauſe the thing is not ſuitable to a craving ſtomake, truly there is the ſame madneſſe in the world; the wind that a man takes in by gaping will as ſoon ſatisfie a craving ſtomake which is ready to famiſh, as all the comforts in the world can ſatisfie a ſoul that knows what true happineſſe means. You would be happy, and you ſeek after ſuch and ſuch comforts in the Creature; well, have you got them, do you find your hearts ſatisfied as having that happineſſe that is ſuitable to you? No, no it is not here but you think it is becauſe you want ſuch and ſuch things, O poor deluded man, it is not becauſe you have not enough of it, but becauſe it is not the thing that is proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>able to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul that God hath given you. <hi>Why do you lay out you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not bread,</hi> In <hi>Iſa. 55. 2. And your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> You are mad people, you ſeek to ſatisfie you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:130622:48"/>
ſtomake with that that is not bread, you follow the wind you will never have Contentment, all creatures in the world ſay Contentment it not in us, riches ſaith Contentment is not in me, pleaſure ſaith Contentment is not in me, if you look for Contentment in the creature you will fail; No, Contentment is higher: When thou comeſt into the School of Chriſt, Chriſt teaches thee that there is a vanity in all things in the world, and the ſoul that by coming into the School of Chriſt, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel comes to ſee the vanity of all things in the world, that's the ſoul that comes to true Contentment. I could tell you of abundance of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences from Heathens that ſhews the vanity of all things in the world, and yet they did not learn the vanity of the Creature in the right School, but now when a Soul comes into the School of Jeſus Chriſt, and there comes to ſee a vanity in all things in the world, then ſuch a ſoul comes to have Contentment. If you ſeek Contentment elſe where, you do like the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſeek for reſt but find none.</p>
               <p>A Third leſſon that Chriſt teaches a Chriſtian when he comes into his School is this, <hi>He learns him to underſtand what that one thing is that is neceſſary which he never came to underſtand before,</hi> you know what he ſaid to <hi>Martha, O Martha thou cumbereſt thy ſelfe about many things, but there is one thing neceſſary.</hi> The Soul before ſought after this and the other thing, but now ſaith the Soul, I ſee really that it is not neceſſary that I ſhould be rich, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould make up my peace with God, it is not necſſary that I ſhould live a pleaſurable life in this world, but it is abſolutly neceſſary that I ſhould have pardon of my ſin, it is not neceſſary that I ſhould have honour and preferment, but it is neceſſary that I ſhould have God to be my portion, and have my part in Jeſus Chriſt, it is neceſſay that my Soul ſhould be ſav'd in the day of Jeſus Chriſt; the other things are pretty fine things indeed, and I ſhould be glad if God would give them me, a fine habitation, and comings in, and cloaths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion for my wife and children, theſe are comfortable things, but theſe are not the neceſſary things, I may have theſe and yet periſh for ever, but the other is abſolutely neceſſary; no matter though I be poor ſo be it I may have that that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:130622:48"/>
neceſſary, thus Chriſt inſtructs the Soul. There's many of you have had ſome thoughts about this that it is indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to provide for your Souls, but when you come in to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s School, there Chriſt cauſes the fear of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fall upon you, and there he cauſes ſuch a real ſight of the great things ofeternity &amp; the abſolute neceſſity of thoſe things, that poſſeſſes your hearts with fear, and that takes you off from all other things in the world. Now I ſhould have ſhown you how that will bring Contentment to the Soul when it comes to be inſtructed in the thing that is abſolutly neceſſary; but thus much for this time.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The leſſon of the vanity of the Creature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The right underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of that one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. A little to inlarge this one &amp; ſo to proceed to others.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Pompie,</hi> that when he was to cary corne to <hi>Rome</hi> in time of dearth, he was in a great deal of danger by ſtormes at Sea, but ſaith he we muſt go on it is neceſſary that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be releived, but it is not neceſſary that we ſhould live. So it would be certainly when the Soul is once taken up with the things that are of abſolute neceſſity, it will not be much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:130622:49"/>
troubled about other things. What are the things that do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet us here but ſome by matters in this world? And it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our hearts are not taken up with that one abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thing, who are the men that are moſt diſcontented, but idle perſons, perſons that have nothing to take up their minds, every little thing diſquiets and diſcontents them, but now a man that hath buſineſſe of great weight and conſequence, if all things goes well with his great buſineſſe that is in his head, he is not ſenſible of meaner things in the family; but now a man that lies at home and hath nothing to do, he finds fault with every thing; ſo it is with the heart, when the heart of a man hath nothing to doe, but to be buſie about creature comforts, every little thing troubles him, but now when the heart is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the weighty things of eternity, with the great things of eternall life, the heart being taken up with them, theſe things that are here below that did diſquiet it before are things now of no conſideration with him in compariſon to the other, ſo as how things fall out here is not much regarded with him, if the one thing that is neceſſary be provided for.</p>
               <p>The Fourth leſſon that the Soul is inſtructed in to come to this knowledge in the art of Contentment is this, <hi>The Soul comes to underſtand in what relation it ſtands in here to the world.</hi> By that I mean thus, <hi>God comes to inſtruct the Soul effectually through Chriſt by his Spirit, upon what tearms it lives here in the world, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it is that it doth ſtand:</hi> as thus, While I live in the world my condition is to be but a pilgrim, a ſtranger, a traveller, and a ſouldiar, now the right underſtanding of this, &amp; being taught this not only by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, that I can ſpeak the words over, but when I come indeed to have my Soul poſſeſt with the conſideration of this truth, that God hath ſet me in this world, not as in my home but as a meer ſtranger and a pilgrim, that I am travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here to another home, and that I am here a ſouldiar in my warfare, it is a mighty help to Contentment in whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls one, as now to inſtance, in all theſe conditions when a man is at home, if he hath not things according to his deſire he will be finding fault and is not contented, but if a man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels abroad, perhaps he mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s not with conveniencies as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the ſervants in the houſe are not at his beck or are not ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:130622:49"/>
diligent as his own ſervants were, and his dyet is not as at home, and his bed not as at home, yet this very thought may moderate a mans ſpirit, I am a traveller, and I muſt not be finding fault, I am but in another mans houſe, and it were not manners for one to find fault when he is abroad in another bodies family though things be not ſo as in my own family; If a man meets with ill weather he muſt be content it is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers fare (we uſe to ſay) both fair weather and foul weather, this is the common travellers fare and we muſt be content with it, but if a man were at home and it ſhould drop down in his houſe he would account it an ill thing, an affliction to him, and he cannot bear it; but when he is travelling abroad though he meet with rain and ſtorms he is not ſo much troubled: When you are abroad at Sea though you have not thoſe many things that you have at home, you are not troubled at it you are contented, Why? You are abroad at Sea, you are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at ſtorms that do ariſe, and though you have many things otherwiſe then you would have them at home but ſtill you are quieted with that you are at Sea. Marriners when they are at Sea they care not what cloaths they have then, though they be picht and tar'd, and but a clout about their necks, and any mean cloaths, but they think when they come home, then they ſhall have their fine ſilke ſtockings, &amp; brave ſutes, &amp; lac'd bands and ſuch things and ſhall be very fine; and ſo they are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad upon that thought that it ſhall be otherwiſe with them when they come home, and though they have nothing but ſault meat, and a little hard fare, yet when they come to their houſes then they ſhall have any thing: Thus it ſhould be with us in this world, the truth is we are all in this world but as Seafaring men, toſt up and down on the waves of the Sea of this world, and our haven is Heaven, and we are here travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but our home it is another world, that long home. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome men have better accomodations then others have in travelling, it's true it's a great mercy of God to us in England in that we can travell with ſuch delight and accomodations more then they can in other Countries, and through Gods mercy we have as great accomodations in our travelling to Heaven in England as any place under Heaven hath, but yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:130622:50"/>
though we do meet with travellers fare ſometimes, yet it ſhould not be greiveous to us: The Scripture tels us plainly that we muſt behave our ſelves here but as pilgrims and ſtrangers, In 1 <hi>Peter, 2. 11. Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which war againſt the Soul:</hi> Conſider what your condition is, you are pilgrims and ſtrangers, do not think to ſatisfie your ſelves here. A man when he comes into an Inn, If there be a fair cupbord of plate he is not troubled that it is not his own, Why? Becauſe he is going away; ſo let us not be troubled when we ſee other men have great eſtates, but we have not, Why? we are going away into another Country, you are lodging here but as it were for a night. If you ſhould live an hundered yeers in compariſon of eternity it is not ſo much as a night, it is but as you were travelling, and were come into an Inn: And were not this a madneſſe for a man to be diſcontent becauſe he hath not what he ſees there, ſeeing it may be he is to go away again within halfe a quarter of an hour? So you find it in <hi>David,</hi> this was the argument that brought off <hi>Davids</hi> heart from the things of this world, and ſet him upon other maner of things, <hi>Pſal. 119. 19. I am a ſtranger in the earth, hide not thy Commandements from me,</hi> I am a ſtranger in the earth (what then) then Lord let me have the knowledge of thy Commandements and it's ſufficient, as for the things of the earth I ſtand not upon them whether I have much or little, but hide not thy Commandements from me, Lord let me know the rule that I ſhould guide my life by.</p>
               <p>Again we are not only travellers but ſouldiers, this is the condition of the life in which we are here in this world: and therefore we are to behave our ſelves accordingly. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes uſe of this argument in writing unto <hi>Timothy 2 Tim. 2. 3. Thou therfore endure hardneſſe as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the very thought of the condition of a man that is a ſouldier, doth ſtill his diſquiet of heart: when he is abroad, he hath not that accomodations in his quarters as he hath in his owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; perhaps a man that had his bed and curtaines drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and all accomodations in his chamber; now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome times he muſt be put to lie upon ſtraw and he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with himſelfe, I am a ſouldier and it is ſutable to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:130622:50"/>
he muſt have his bed warm'd at home, but he muſt lie abroad in the fields when he is a ſouldier, and the very thought of this condition in which he ſtands, quiets him in all things: yea and he goes rejoycing, to think this is but ſutable to my condition in which God hath put me: ſo it ſhould be with us in reſpect of this world. Now would it not be an unſeemely thing to ſee a ſouldier go whyning up and downe with the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the eye and complayning, that he hath not hot meat every meale, and his bed warm'd as he had at home. Now Chriſtians they know that they are in their warfare, they are here in this world fighting and combating with the enemyes of their ſouls and eternal condition, and they muſt be willing to endure hardnes here. The right underſtanding of this, that God hath put them into ſuch a condition, it is that that will content them, eſpecially when they conſider that they are certain of the victory and that ere long they ſhall tryumph with Jeſus Chriſt and then all their ſorrowes ſhall be don a way and their teares wiped from their eyes. A ſouldier is content to indure hardnes though he knows not that he ſhall have the victory, but a Chriſtian knows himſelfe to be a ſouldier, and knows that he ſhall conquer and triumph with Jeſus Chriſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And that's the fourth leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the ſoul when he brings it into his School, to learn the Art of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he makes him underſtand throughly the relation in which he hath blaced him in, in this world.</p>
               <p>The fifth leſſon that Chriſt teaches it is this, <hi>He teacheth us wherein conſiſts any good that is to be enjoyed in any creature in the world,</hi> it's true before it hath been taught that there is a vanity in the Creature, that is, take the Creature conſidered in its ſelfe, but yet though there be a vanity in the Creature in its ſelfe, in reſpect of ſatisfying the Soul for its portion, yet there is ſome goodneſſe in the Creature, though there be a vanity there's ſome deſirableneſſe: But wherein doth that conſiſt? It conſiſts not in the nature of the Creature it ſelfe, for that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity, but it conſiſts in the reference it hath to the firſt being of all things, this is a Leſſon that Chriſt teaches, if there be any good in an eſtate, or in any comforts in this world, it is not ſomuch that it pleaſes my ſenſe, that it is ſutable to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:130622:51"/>
my body, but the reference it hath to God the firſt being, that by theſe creatures there ſhould be ſomewhat of Gods goodneſſe conveyed to me, and I may have a ſanctified uſe of the creature to draw me neerer to God, and that I enjoy more of God, and be made more ſerviceable for the glory of God in the place where God hath ſet me, here's the good of the Creature; Oh were we but inſtructed in this Leſſon, did we but underſtand, and throughly beleeve this to be a truth, that there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the world hath any goodneſſe in it any further then it hath reference to the firſt infinit ſupream good of all, that ſo farre as I can enjoy God in it ſo farre it is good to me, and ſo fare as I doe not enjoy God in it, ſo farre there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any thing that I have in the Creature, how eaſie were it then for one to be contented; as thus, ſuppoſe a man had a great eſtate but a few years agoe, and now it is all gone; I would but appeale to this man, when you had your eſtate wherein did you account the good of that eſtate to conſiſt? a carnall heart would ſay, any body might know that; that it brought me in ſo much a year, and that I could fare of the beſt, and be a man of repute in the place where I live, and men would regard what I ſaid, I might be cloathed as I would, and lay up porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my children, in this conſiſted the good of my eſtate; this man now never came into the Schoole of Chriſt to know wherein the good of an eſtate did conſiſt, no marvail if he be diſquieted when he hath loſt his eſtate: But now a Chriſtian that hath been in the School of Chriſt, and hath been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the art of Contentment, when ſuch a one hath an eſtate, he thinks, in that I have an eſtate above my brethren, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the good of it to me, in that I have an opportunity to ſerve God the better, and I enjoy a great deal of Gods mercy to my Soule conveyed to me through the Creature, and hereby I am inabled to doe a great deal of good, and therein I account the good of my eſtate. Now God hath taken this away from me, now if God will be pleaſed to make up the enjoyment of himſelfe another way; that is, will call me to honour him by ſuffering, and if I may doe God as much ſervice now in my way of ſuffering, that is to ſhew forth the Grace of his ſpirit in the way of my ſuffering as I did in the way of proſperity, I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:130622:51"/>
have as much of God as I had before; if I may be led to God in my low condition, as much as I was in my proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have as much comfort and contentment as I had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But you will ſay it is true if I could honour God in my low eſtate as much as in my proſperous eſtate then it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but how can that be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt know the ſpeciall honour that God hath from his creatures in this world, it is the manifeſtation of the Graces of his ſpirit; It's true, God hath a great deal of honour when a man is in a publick place, and ſo he is able to do a great deal of good, to countenance Godlineſſe, and diſcountenance Sin, but the main thing is in our <hi>ſhewing forth the vertues of him that hath called us out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light.</hi> Now if I can ſay that through Gods mercy in my affliction I find the Graces of Gods ſpirit working as ſtrongly in me as ever they did when I had my eſtate, I am where I was, yea I am fully in as good a condition, for I have that good now that I had in my proſperous eſtate, for I accounted the good of it but in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, and honouring of God, and now God hath bleſt the want of it to ſtir up the Graces of his ſpirit in my ſoule, and this is the worke that now God cals me to, and I muſt account God is moſt honoured when I doe the worke that he cals me to, he ſet me a worke in my proſperous eſtate at that time, to honour him in that condition; and now he ſets me a work at this time to honour him in this condition: Now God is moſt honoured when I can turne from one condition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according as he cals me to it; would you account your ſelves to be honoured by your ſervants, when you ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a worke that hath ſome excellency, and they will go on and on, and you cannot get them off from it? Now let the work be never ſo good, yet if you will call them off to another work you doe expect that they ſhould manifeſt ſo much reſpect to you as to be content to come off from that, though they be ſet about a meaner work, if it be more ſutable to your ends. So you were in a proſperous eſtate, and there God called you to ſome ſervice that you took ſome pleaſure in; but ſuppoſe God ſaith, I will uſe you in ſuffering condition, and I will have you honour me in that way, now here's the honouring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:130622:52"/>
of God that you can turn this way or that way, as God cals you to it; thus now you having learned this, that the good of the Creature conſiſts in the enjoyment of God in it, and the honouring of God by it, you can be content, becauſe you have the ſame good that you had before, and that's the fift Leſſon,</p>
               <p>The ſixt Leſſon that Chriſt doth teach the Soul that hee brings into this School, is this, <hi>He doth inſtruct ſuch a man or woman in the knowledge of their own hearts,</hi> you muſt learn this or you will never learn Contentment, you muſt learne to know your own hearts well, to be good ſtudents of your own hearts, you cannot all be Schollers in the arts and ſciences in the world, but you may all be ſtudents in your own hearts, you cannot reade in the Booke many of you, but God expects that every day you ſhould turn over a leafe in your own hearts, you will never come to get any skill in this Myſterie, except you ſtudy the Book of your own hearts; Marriners they have their Books that they ſtudy, thoſe that will be good Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, and Schollers they have their Books, thoſe that ſtudy Logick they have their Books according to that, and thoſe that would ſtudy Rhetorick and Philoſophy have their Books according to that, and thoſe that ſtudy Divinity they have their Books whereby they come to be helped in the ſtudy of Divinity, but a Chriſtian next to the Book of God is to look into the Book of his own heart, and to read over that, and this will helpe you to Contentment theſe three ways.</p>
               <p>1 By the ſtudying of thy heart thou <hi>wilt come preſently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover wherein thy diſcontent lyes,</hi> when thou art diſcontented thou wilt find out the root of any diſcontentment if thou doeſt ſtudy thy heart well, many men and women they are diſcontented, and the truth is they know not wherefore, they think this and the other thing is the cauſe, but a man or woman that knowes their own heart they will find out preſently where the root of their diſcontent lyes, that it lyes in ſuch a corruption, and diſtemper of my heart, that now through Gods mercy I have found out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is in this caſe as it is with a little child that is very froward in the houſe, if a ſtranger comes in he doth not know what the matter is, perhaps the Stranger will give the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:130622:52"/>
child a rattle, or a nut, or ſuch a thing to quiet it, but when the Nurſe comes ſhe knows the temper and diſpoſition of the Child, and therefore knows beſt how to quiet it; ſo it is here juſt thus for all the world, when we are ſtrangers with our own hearts we are mightily diſcontented, and know not how to quiet our ſelves, becauſe we know not wherein the diſquiet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and indeed when we are ſtrangers to our own hearts we cannot tell how to quiet our ſelves, but if we be very well verſt in our own hearts, when any thing fals out ſo as to diſquiet us, we find out the cauſe of it preſently, and ſo quickly come to be quiet, ſo a man that hath a Watch, and he underſtands the uſe of every wheel and pin, if it goes amiſſe he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find out the cauſe of it: but one that hath no skill in a Watch, when it goes amiſſe he knows not what the matter is, and therefore cannot mend it. So indeed our hearts are as a Watch, and there are many wheels, and windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings there, and we ſhould labour to know our hearts well, that when they are out of tune we may know what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is.</p>
               <p>2 This knowledge of our hearts will help us to Contentment, becauſe by this <hi>we ſhall come to know what is moſt ſutable to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> As thus, a man that knows not his own heart he thinks not what need he hath of affliction, and upon that he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, but that man or woman that hath ſtudied their own hearts, when God comes with afflictions upon them, they can ſay I would not for any thing in the world have been without this affliction, God hath ſo ſuted this affliction to my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath come in ſuch a way, that if this affliction had not come I am affraid I ſhould have fallen into ſinne; a poor country man that takes phiſick, the phiſick works &amp; he thinks it will kill him, becauſe he knows not the ill humours that are in his body, and therefore he underſtands not how ſutable the phyſick is to him, but a Phyſician takes a purge, and it makts him extreamly ſick, ſaith the Phyſician I like this the better, it doth but work upon the humour that I know is the matter of my diſeaſe, and upon that ſuch a man that hath knowledge and underſtanding in his body, and the cauſe of his diſtemper, he is not troubled or diſquieted: So would we be if we did but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:130622:53"/>
know the diſtempers of our own hearts, carnall men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they know not their own ſpirits, and therefore they fling and vex upon every affliction that doth befall them, they know not what diſtempers are in their hearts that may be healed by their afflictions, if it pleaſe God to give them a ſanctified uſe of them.</p>
               <p>3. By knowing their own hearts <hi>they know what they are able to manage,</hi> and by this means they come to be Content, the Lord perhaps takes away many comforts from them that they had before, or denies them ſome things that they hoped to have got; now they by knowing their hearts know this, that they were not able to manage ſuch an eſtate, and they were not able to manage ſuch proſperity, God ſaw it, and (ſaith a poor ſoul) Iam in ſome meaſure convinced by looking into mine own heart, that I was not able to manage ſuch a condition. A man deſires greedily to gripe more perhaps then he is able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and ſo undoes himſelfe, as countrey men doe obſerve, that if they doe over-ſtock their Land it will quickly ſpoyl them, and ſo a wiſe Huſband-man that knows how much his ground will bear he is not troubled that he hath not ſo much ſtock as others, why? becauſe he knows he hath not ground enough for ſo great a ſtock, and that quiets him; ſo many men and women that know not their own hearts, they would fain have a proſperous eſtate as others have, but if they knew their own hearts they would know that they were not able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it; if one of your little children of three or four years old ſhould be crying for the coat of her that is twelve or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old, and ſay, why may not I have a coat as long as my ſiſters? If ſhe had, it would ſoon trip up her heels, and break her face, but when the Child comes to underſtanding ſhe is not diſcontented, becauſe her coat is not ſo long as her ſiſters, (but ſaith) my coat is fit for me, and therein takes Content; ſo if we come to underſtanding in the School of Chriſt we will not cry why have not I ſuch an eſtate as others have? the Lord ſeeth that I am not able to manage it and I ſee it my ſelf by the knowing of mine own heart. You ſhall have children if they ſee but a knife, they will cry for it becauſe they know not their ſtrength and that they are not able to mannage it, but you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:130622:53"/>
know they are not able to mannage it and therefore you will not give it them, and when they come to ſo much underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to know that they are not able to mannage it they will not cry for it; ſo we would not cry for ſuch and ſuch things if we knew that we were not able to mannage them: when you vex and fret for what you have not, I may ſay to you as Chriſt ſaith you know not of what ſpirits you are of. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to <hi>Parillus</hi> ſaith he (when they were ſpeaking about his extream poverty,) <hi>Not ſo poor, though I have been very poor, yet I would be poorer; I could be willing to be poorer then I am,</hi> for the truth is (as if he ſhould ſay) the Lord knew that that was more ſutable to me, and I knew that my own heart was ſuch, that a poor condition was more ſutable to me then a rich, ſo certainly would we ſay if we knew our own hearts, that ſuch and ſuch a condition is better for me then if it had been otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Seventh leſſon, <hi>Is the burden of a proſperous eſtate.</hi> Such a one that comes into Chriſts School to be inſtructed in this Art, never comes to attain to any great skill in this Art until he comes to underſtand the burden that is in a proſperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay what burden is there in a proſperous eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly a great burden, and there needs a great ſtrength to bear it, as men had need of ſtrong brains that can bear ſtrong wine, ſo they had need of ſtronge ſpirits that are able to bear proſperous conditions, and not to do themſelves hurt; there's a fourfould burden in a proſperous eſtate. Many men and women look at the ſhine and glittering of proſperity, but they little think of the burden, but there's a fourfould burden.</p>
               <p>1. There's <hi>A burden of trouble;</hi> a roſe hath it's prickles, and ſo the Scripture ſaith that he that will be rich pierceth himſelf through with many ſorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. If a mans heart be ſet upon it that he muſt be rich, and he will be rich, ſuch a man will pierce himſelf through with many ſorrows; he looks upon the delight and glory of riches that appears outwardly, but he conſiders not what pierceing ſorrows he may meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:130622:54"/>
in them: The conſideration of the trouble in a proſperous condition I have divers times thought of, and I cannot tell by what ſimilitude to expreſſe it better then by travelling in ſome champian country, where round about is very fair and ſandy ground, and you ſee there a town a great way of in a bottom, and you think Oh how bravely is that town ſeated, but when you come and ride into the town, you ſhall ride through a dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lane and through a company of fearful durty holes, and you could not ſee the durty lane and holes when you were two or three mile off; ſo ſometimes we look upon the proſperity of men and think ſuch a man lives bravly and comfortably, but if we did but know what troubles he meets withall in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his eſtate, in his dealings with men, we would not think his condition ſo happy. One may have a very fine new ſhoe, but no body knows where it pinches him but he that hath it on; ſo you think ſuch and ſuch men are happy, but they may have many troubles that you little think of.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There is a burden of danger in it,</hi> men that are in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition they are in a great deal of danger, you ſee ſome times in the evening when you light up your candles, the mothes and gnats will be flying up and down in the candle, but they ſcorch their wings, and there they fall down dead, ſo there is a great deal of danger in a proſperous eſtate, thoſe men that are ſet upon a Pinacle on high, theſe men they are in greater danger then other men are. Honey we know doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Bees and Waſps unto it, and ſo the ſweet of proſperity doth invite the Devill and temptation. Men that are in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous eſtate are ſubject to many temptations that other men are not ſubject to. The Scripture cals the Devill Beelzebub, that is the God of flies, &amp; ſo <hi>Beelzebub</hi> comes where the honey of proſperity is, they are in very great danger of temptations that are in a proſperous condition. The dangers of men that are in a proſperous eſtate that have more then others, ſhould be conſidered of by thoſe that are lower, think with thy ſelfe though they be above me, yet they are in more danger then I am, the tal trees are more ſhattered a great deal then low ſhrubs, ſo you know the ſhip that hath al the ſails up, the top ſail &amp; all in a ſtorm, this is in more danger then that that hath al the ſails
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:130622:54"/>
drawn in: And ſo men that have their Top-gallant, and all up and brave they are more like to be drowned, drowned in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then other men are, and therefore you know what the Scripture ſaith, how hard it is that rich men ſhould go into the Kingdom of Heaven, ſuch a text ſhould make poor people to Contented with their eſtates. We have a notable example for that in the Children of <hi>Kohath,</hi> you ſhall find that they were in a more excellent eſtate then the other of the Levites, but they were in more danger then the other, and more trouble.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Children of <hi>Kohath</hi> were in a higher conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then other of the Levites, that Ile ſhew you out of the fourth of <hi>Numb. 4. v.</hi> there you ſhall find what their condition was. <hi>This ſhall be the ſervice of the ſons of Kohath in the Tabernacle of the Congregation about the moſt holy things:</hi> marke, the Levites were exerciſed about <hi>holy things,</hi> but the ſons of <hi>Kohath</hi> their ſervice was about the <hi>moſt holy things</hi> of all, and you ſhall find in the 21. of <hi>Joſhua, verſ.</hi> 10. That God did honour the ſons of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath</hi> in a more ſpeciall manner then he did honour the other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, which honour the Children of <hi>Aaron</hi> (being of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>Koathites,</hi> who were of the Children of <hi>Levi</hi>) had; for theirs was the firſt lot, and they were preferd before the other families of <hi>Levi,</hi> thoſe that were imployed in the moſt honourable imployment, they had the moſt honourable Lot, the firſt Lot: fell to them: thus you ſee God honoured the Children of the <hi>Kohathite.</hi> But (might other Levites ſay) how hath God preferd this family before us? They are honoured more then the other were? But now marke their burden that comes in with their honour, and that Ile ſhew you out of two Scriptures, the firſt is, <hi>Numb. 7, 6. 7. 8. 9. And</hi> Moſes <hi>took the Wagons, and the Oxen, and gave them unto the Levites, two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the ſons of</hi> Gerſhom, <hi>according to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the ſons of</hi> Merari <hi>according unto their ſervice, under the hand of</hi> Ithamar <hi>the ſon of</hi> Aar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Prieſt,</hi> but ſaith he in the 9 <hi>ver. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the ſons of Kohath he gave none, becauſe the ſervice of the Sanctuary that belonged unto them, was, that they ſhould bear upon their ſhoulders.</hi> Mark, the other Levits had oxen, and wagons given to them, to eaſe them of their ſervice, but (ſaith he) to the ſons of <hi>Kohath</hi> he gave none,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:130622:55"/>
but they ſhould bear their ſervice upon their ſhoulders, and that's the reaſon why God was ſo diſpleaſed, becauſe that they would have more eaſe in Gods ſervice then God would have them, for whereas they ſhould cary it upon their ſhoulders, they would cary it upon a cart, mark here you ſee the firſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that they had, beyond what the other Levits had; and thoſe indeed that are in more honourable place then others, thoſe that are under them think not of their burden that they are to cary upon their ſhoulders, when as others have means to eaſe them, and many times thoſe that are imployed in the Miniſtery, or Majeſtracy that ſit at the ſtern to order the great affairs of the Common-wealth and State, you think they live bravely, they lye awake when you are aſleep, if you knew the burden that lay upon their ſpirits, you would think that your labour and burden were very little in compariſon of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. There's another burden of danger more then the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that you ſhall find in <hi>Numb. 4. 17. And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaying, Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the</hi> Kohathits <hi>from among the</hi> Levits, <hi>but thus do unto them that they may live and not die: When they approach unto the moſt holy things,</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons ſhall go in and appoint them every one to his ſervice and to his burden; but they ſhall not go in to ſee when the holy things are covered, leſt they die:</hi> Mark this text, ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Cut ye not off the tribe of the family of the <hi>Kohath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> from among the <hi>Levites,</hi> cut them not off why? what had they done? had they done any thing amiſſe? no they had not done any thing that provoked God, but the meaning is this; take a great care of the family of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> to inſtruct them in their duty that they were to do, for (ſaith God) they are in a gteat deal of danger, being to ſerve in the moſt holy things, if they ſhould go in to ſee the holy things more then God would have them it's as much as their lives are worth, and therefore if you ſhould but neglect them, and not informe them thorowly in their duty they would be undon: (ſaith God) they are to adminiſter in the moſt holy things, and if they ſhould but dare to preſume to do any thing otherwiſe then God would have them about thoſe ſervices it would coſt them their lives, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:130622:55"/>
therefore be not you careleſſe of them, for if you neglect them you will be a means of cutting them off. Thus you ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the family of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> were in, they were prefer'd before others but they were in more danger. So you think there are ſuch men in a pariſh that bear the ſway and that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed inpublike ſervice, and they carry all before them, but you conſider not their danger. And ſo the Miniſters, they ſtand in the fore-front of all the ſpight and mallice of ungodly men, indeed God imployes them in honourable ſervice, and that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the Angels would take delight in, but though the ſervice be honourable, above the imployment of other works, yet the burden of danger that likewiſe is greater then the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of men that are in an inferiour condition: Now when the Soul comes to get wiſdom from Chriſt to think of the danger that it is in, then it will be content with that low eſtate in which it is. A poor man that is in a low condition, thinks I am low and others are raiſed, but I know not what their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is, and ſo if he be rightly inſtructed in the School of Chriſt he comes to be contented.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>In a proſperous eſtate there is the burden of duty,</hi> you look only at the ſweet and comfort that they have, and the honour and reſpect that they have that are in a proſperous condition, but you muſt conſider of the duty that they owe to God, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more duty at their hands then at yours, you are ready to be diſcontent that you have not ſuch parts and abilities as ſuch have, but God requires more duty of them that have more parts, God requires more duty of them that have greater eſtates then of you that have not ſuch eſtates, Oh you would fain have the honour, but can you carry the burden of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>4. The laſt <hi>is the burden of account in a proſperous eſtate.</hi> There is a great account that they are to give to God that injoy great eſtates and a proſperous condition: Now we are all ſtewards, and one is a ſteward to a meaner man, perhaps but to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary knight, another is a ſteward to a noble man, an Earle, now the ſteward of the meaner man, he hath not ſo much as the other hath under his hand, now ſhall he be diſcontented becauſe there comes not ſo much under his hand as under the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:130622:56"/>
others? No thinks he I have leſſe, and I am to give the leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: So your account in compariſon of the Miniſters and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats will be nothing, you are to give an account of your owne ſouls, and ſo are they, you are to give an account for your owne family, and ſo are they, but you are not to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for congregations, and for townes, and cityes and countryes. You thinke of Princes and Kings, Oh what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition they are in. But what do you thinke of a King to give account for the diſorder and wickedneſſe in a kingdome that he poſſibly might have prevented? What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of glory might a Prince bring to God if ſo be that he bent his ſoul and al his thoughts to lift up the name of God in a kingdome, now what God looſes for want of this, that King Prince or Governour he muſt give an account for. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in that place of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> where it's ſaid that men muſt give an account for their ſouls, he wonders that any man in publique place can be ſaved becauſe their account is ſo great that they are to give, and I remember I have read a ſpeech of <hi>Philip</hi> that was King of Spaine, though the ſtory ſaith of him that he had ſuch a natural conſcience, that he profeſt he would not do any thing againſt his conſcience, no not in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for the gayning of a world, yet when this man was to die, Oh ſaith he that I had never bin a King, Oh that I had liv'd a ſollitary and privat life all my daies, then ſhould I have dyed a great deale more ſecurely, I ſhould with more conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

there is anexed to it the burden of trouble, and of danger and of duty, and of account. And thus you ſee how Chriſt traines up his ſchollers in his ſchool and though they be weake otherwiſe, yet by his Spirit he gives them wiſdome to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things aright.</p>

We have not indeed in Scripture any certaine evident ſign of a reprobate, we cannot ſay except we knew a man had comitted the ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt that he is a reprobate, for we know not what God may work upon him, but the neereſt of all and the blackeſt ſign of a reprobate is this, for God to give up a man to his hearts deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing that God conveys his wrath more through then a proſperous eſtate.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:130622:57"/>
I remember I have read of a Jewiſh Tradition that they ſay of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> when God ſtruck <hi>Vzziah</hi> with a Leproſie, they ſay that the beams of the Sun was darted upon the fore-head of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> and he was ſtruck with a Leproſie by the darting of the beams of the Sun upon his fore head; the Scripture ſaith, Indeed the Prieſts looked upon him, but they ſay there was a ſpeciall light and beam of the Sun upon the fore-head that did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Leproſie to the Prieſts, and they ſay it was the way of conveying of it. Whether that were true or no I am ſure this is true, that the ſtrong beams of the Sun of proſperity upon many men makes them to be leprous; would any poor man in the countrey have been diſcontented that he was not in <hi>Vzziahs</hi> condition? he was a great King, I but there was the Leproſie in his fore-head, the poor man may ſay, though I live meanly in the countrey yet I thank God my body is whole and ſound, would not any man rather have ruſſet and skins of beaſts to cloath him with, then to have ſattin and velvet that ſhould have the Plague in it? The Lord conveys the plague of his curſe through proſperity, as much as through any thing in the world, and therefore the ſoul coming to underſtand this, this makes it to be quiet and content.</p>
               <p>And then ſpirituall judgements are the greateſt judgements of all; the Lord lays ſuch an affliction upon my outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but what if he had taken away my life, a mans health is a greater mercy then his eſtate, and you that are poor people you ſhould conſider of that; but is the health of a mans body better then his eſtate? what is the health of a mans ſoul? that's a great deal better; the Lord hath inflicted externall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he hath not inflicted ſpirituall judgements upon thee, he hath not given thee up to hardneſſe of heart, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the ſpirit of prayer from thee in thine afflicted eſtate, oh then be of good comfort though there be outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon thee, yet thy ſoul thy more excellent part is not affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Now when the ſoul comes to underſtand this, that here lyes the ſore wrath of God to be given-up to a mans deſires, and for ſpirituall judgements to be upon a man; this quiets him, and contents him, though outward afflictions be upon him, perhaps one of a mans children hath the fit of an ague, or the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:130622:57"/>
tooth ake, but perhaps his next neighbour hath the plague, or all his Children are dead of the Plague, now ſhall he be ſo diſcontented, becauſe his Children hath the tooth-ach when his neighbours children are dead? now think thus, Lord thou haſt laid an afflicted conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon me, but Lord thou haſt not given me the Plague of a hard heart. Now take theſe eight things before mentioned, and lay them together, and you may well apply that Scripture in the 29. of <hi>Jſay,</hi> the laſt verſe, ſaith the text there. <hi>They alſo that erred in ſpirit, ſhall come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and they that murmured ſhall learn doctrine.</hi> Hath there bin any of you (as I fear many may be found) that have erred in ſpirit, even in regard of this truth that now we are preaching of, and many that have murmured, Oh that this day you might come to underſtand, that Chriſt would bring you into his School, and teach you underſtanding, <hi>And they that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured ſhall learn doctrine,</hi> what doctrine ſhall they learn?

               <p>The Ninth and laſt leſſon that Chriſt teaches thoſe that he doth inſtruct in this Art of Contentment, <hi>It is the right knowledge of Gods providence,</hi> and therein are theſe Four things.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>The univerſality of providence,</hi> that the Soul muſt be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in to come to this Art, to underſtand the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of providence, that is; how the providence of God goes through the whole world, extends it's ſelf to every thing: Not only that God by his providence doth rule the world, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all things in generall, but that it reaches to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, not only to Kingdoms, to order the great affairs of Kingdoms but it reaches to every mans family, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eaches to every perſon in the family, it reaches to every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea to every paſſage to every thing that falls out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee in every particular, not one hair falleth from thy head, not a Sparrow to the ground without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God. There's nothing befalls thee good or evill, but there is a providence of the infinite eternall firſt Being in that thing, and therein indeed is Gods infiniteneſſe, that it reaches to the leaſt things, to the leaſt worm that is under thy feet: Then much more it reaches unto thee that art a rationall creature, the providence of God is more ſpeciall towards rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall creatures then any others: The underſtanding in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:130622:58"/>
way the univerſality of providence in every particular paſſage from morning to night every day; that theres not any thing that doth befall thee but there's a hand of God in it, it is from God, it is a mighty furtherance to Contentment. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will grant the truth of the thing that it is ſo, but as the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb. 11. 3. By faith we underſtand that the worlds were made,</hi> by faith we underſtand it, why by faith? we can underſtand by reaſon that no finit thing can be from it ſelfe: And therefore that the world could not be of it's ſelf, but we can underſtand it by faith in another manner then by reaſon. So whatſoever we underſtand of God in way of providence, yet when Chriſt doth take us into his School wee come to underſtand it by faith in a better manner then wee doe by reaſon.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>The efficacie that there is in providence;</hi> that is, that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God goes on in all things with ſtrength and power, and it is not to be altered by our power, let us be diſcontented and vext and troubled, and fret, and rage, yet we muſt not thinke to alter the courſe of providence by our diſcontent. Some of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſaid to him, <hi>Shall the earth be forſaken for thee; and ſhall the rock be removed out of his place? Job</hi> 18. 4. when they ſaw him to be impatient, ſo I may ſay to every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented impatient heart, what ſhall the providence of God change it's courſe for thee? Do'ſt thou think it ſuch a weake thing that becauſe it doth not pleaſe thee it muſt alter it's courſe? be thou content or not content the providence of God will go on, it hath an efficacie of power, of virtue, to carry all things before it, canſt thou make one hair black or white with all the ſtir that thou keepeſt? When you are in a ſhip at Sea that hath all her ſails ſpread with a full gale of wind and ſwiftly ſailing; can you make it ſtand ſtill with running up and down in the ſhip? No more can you make the providence of God to alter and change it's courſe with your vexing and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but it will go on with power do what thou canſt. Do but underſtand the power and efficacie of providence and it will be a mighty means for the helping to learn this leſſon of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>The infinite variety of the works of providence,</hi> and yet <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:130622:59"/>
of things, one working towards another;</hi> there is infinite variet<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the works of God in an ordinary providence, and yet, all work in an orderly way; we put theſe two together, for God in the way of his providence cauſes a thouſand thouſand things one to depend upon another, there are infinite ſeverall wheels (as I may ſo ſay) in the works of providence, all the works that ever God did from all eternity or ever will do, put them all together, and all make up but one work, and they have been as ſeverall wheels that have had their orderly motion to attain the end that God from all eternity hath appointed: We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed look at things by peices, we look at one particular and do not conſider the reference that one thing hath to another, but God he looks at all things at once, and ſees the reference that one thing hath to another: As a child that looks upon a clock, looks firſt upon one wheel, and then upon another wheel, he looks not at all together or the dependance that one hath upon another, but the workman hath his eyes upon all together and ſees the dependance of all one upon another, and the art that there is in the dependance of one upon another, ſo it is in Gods providence. Now obſerve how this works to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; where there is ſuch a paſſage of providence befalls me, that's one wheel, and it may be if this wheel ſhould be ſtopt, there might a thouſand other things come to be ſtopt by this: As in a clock, ſtop but one wheel and you ſtop every wheel, becauſe they have dependance one upon another; ſo when God hath ordered a thing for the preſent to be thus and thus, how do'ſt thou know how many things do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thing? God may have ſome work that he hath to doe twenty years hence that may depend upon this paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that falls out this day, or this week. And here (by the way) we may ſee a great deal of evill that there is in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for thou wouldeſt have Gods providence altered in ſuch and ſuch a particular, indeed if if it were only in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that had reference to nothing elſe it were not ſo much, but by thy deſire to have thy will in ſuch a particular, it may be thou wouldeſt croſſe God in a thouſand things that he hath to bring about, becauſe it's poſſible there may be a thouſand things depend upon that one thing that thou wouldeſt faine
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:130622:59"/>
have to be otherwiſe then it is, juſt as if a childe ſhould cry out and ſay let but that one wheel ſtop, though he faith but one wheel, yet if that ſtop, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay they muſt all ſtop; ſo in providence, let but this one paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſtop, it is as much as if a thouſand ſtopt: Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be quiet and content, for though I be croſt in ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular God attains his end, at leaſt his end may be furthered in a thouſand things by this one thing that I am croſt in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let a man conſider this is an act of providence, and how do I know what God is about to doe, and how many things depend upon this providence? Now we are willing to ſuffer our friends will to be croſt in one thing, ſo that our friend may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what he deſires in a thouſand things; if thou haſt a love and friendſhip to God, be willing to be croſt in ſome few things, that the Lord may have his work go on in the univerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in a thouſand of otherthings. Now that's the Third thing to be underſtood in Gods providence, that Chriſt doth learn thoſe that he teacheth in the Art of Contentment.</p>
               <p>4 Chriſt teaches them the knowledge of providence, that is, <hi>The knowledge of Gods uſuall way in his dealings with his people more particularly.</hi> The other is the knowledge of God in his providence in general: But the right underſtanding of the way of God in his providence towards his people and Saints, is a notable leſſon to help us in the Art of Contentment. If we come once to know a mans way and courſe we may better ſute and be contented to live with him, then before we come to know his way and courſe; as when a man comes to live in a ſociety with men and women, it may be the men and women may be good, but till a man comes to know their way and courſe and diſpoſition, many things may fall very croſſe, and we think they are very hard, but when we come to be aquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their way and ſpirits, then we can ſute and cotten with them very well; and the reaſon of our trouble is becauſe we do not underſtand their way. So it is with you, thoſe that are but as ſtrangers to God, and do not underſtand the way of God, they are troubled with the providences of God, and they think them very ſtrange and cannot tell what to make of them, becauſe they underſtand not the ordinary courſe and way of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:130622:60"/>
God towards his people. If a ſtranger ſometimes comes into a family and ſees ſuch and ſuch things done, hee wonders what the matter is, but thoſe that are aquainted with it it troubles them not at all. So ſervants when they come firſt together and know not one another it may be they are froward and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but when they come to be aquainted with one anothers waies then they are more contented; juſt ſo it is when we come firſt to underſtand Gods waies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, what do you underſtand by Gods waies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By that I mean theſe three things. And when we come to know them we ſhall not wonder ſo much at the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, but be quiet and contented with them.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt thing is this, <hi>Gods ordinary courſe is that his people in this world ſhould be in an afflicted condition,</hi> God hath revealed in his word &amp; we may there find he hath ſet it down to be his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begining of the world to this day, but more eſpecially in the times of the Goſpel, that his people here ſhould be in an afflicted condition. Now men that do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, they ſtand and wonder to hear of the people of God that they are afflicted, and the enemyes proſper in their way, for thoſe that ſeeke God in his way and ſeeke for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for them to be afflicted routed and ſpoiled and then ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to prevaile they wonder at it, but now one that is in the ſchoole of Chriſt, he is taught by Jeſus Chriſt that God by his eternal counſels hath ſet this to be his courſe &amp; way, to bring up his people in this world in an afflicted condition, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>account it not ſtrange concerning the firey tryal.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. we are not therfore to be diſcontented with it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath ſet ſuch a courſe and way, and we know ſuch is the will of God that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that is in Gods way is this. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually when God intends the greateſt mercy to any of his people he doth bring them into the loweſt condition,</hi> God doth ſeem to go quite croſſe and worke in a contrary way; when he intends the greateſt mercys to his people he doth firſt uſually bring them into very low conditions, if it be a bodily mercie, an outward mercie that he intends to beſtow he uſeth to bring them bodily low, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:130622:60"/>
low, if it be a mercie in their eſtates that he intends to beſtow he brings them low in that and then raiſes them; and in their names he brings them low there and then raiſes them, and in their Spirits God doth ordinarily bring their ſpirits low and then raiſes their ſpirits, uſually the people of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greateſt comforts have the greateſt afflictions and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, now thoſe that underſtand not Gods ways they think that when God brings his people into ſad conditions, that God leaves and forſakes them and that God doth intend no great matter of good to them, but now a Child of God that is inſtructed in this way of God, he is not troubled; my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very low, but (ſaith he) this is Gods way when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the greateſt mercie, to bring men under the greateſt afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When he intended to raiſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be the Second in the Kingdom, God caſt him into a dungeon a little before. So when God intended to raiſe <hi>David</hi> and ſet him upon the Throne, he made him to be hunted as a partridge in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 20, God went this way with his Son; Chriſt himſelfe went into glory by ſuffering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10, and if God deale ſo with his owne Son much more with his people; as a little before break of day you ſhall obſerve it is darker then it was any time before, ſo God doth uſe to make our conditions darker a little before the mercie come. When God beſtowed the laſt great mercie at <hi>Nazby</hi> we were in a very low condition, God knew what he had to doe before hand, he knew that his time was coming for great mercies, it is the way of God to doe ſo. Be but inſtructed aright in this courſe and tract that God uſes to walke in and that will helpe us to contentment excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>The third thing that there is in Gods way and courſe is this, <hi>It is the way of God to work by contraries, to turne the greateſt evill into the greateſt good.</hi> To grant great good after great evill is one thing, and to turne great evills into the greateſt good that's another, and yet that's Gods way, the greateſt good that God intends for his people, many times he works it out of the greateſt evill, the greateſt light is brought out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darkneſſe; and <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) hath a notable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this, (ſaith he) it is the way of God, he doth humble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:130622:61"/>
that he might exalt, he doth kill that he might make alive, he doth confound that he might glorifie, this is the way of God (ſaith hee,) but ſaith hee, every one doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, this is the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, the knowledg of knowledges to underſtand this, that God doth uſe when he will bring life, he doth bring it out of death, he brings joy out of ſorrow, and he brings proſperity out of adverſity, yea and many times brings grace out of ſin, that is, makes uſe of ſin to work furtherance of grace, it's the way of God to bring all good out of evill; not onely to overcome the evill, but to make the evill to work toward the good, here's the way of God; now when the ſoule comes to underſtand this, it wil take away our murmurring and bring Contentment into our ſpirits: But I fear there are but few that underſtand it aright, perhaps they read of ſuch things, &amp; hear ſuch things in a ſermon, but they are not by Jeſus Chriſt inſtructed in this, that this is the way of God to bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt evill,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now thus having diſpatcht the third head, the Leſſons that we are to learne, we come to the fourth, and that is</hi> The excellency of this Grace of Contentment, <hi>and there is a great deale of excellency in Contentment, that's a kind of Leſſon too for us to learn. And this head likewiſe will be ſomewhat long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saith the Apoſtle <hi>J have learned,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, bleſſed be God for this: Oh! it is a mercy of God to me that I have learned this Leſſon, I find ſo much good in this Contentment, that I would not for a world but have it, I have learned it ſaith he.</p>
               <p>Now the very Heathens had a ſight of a great excellency that there is in Contentment; I remember I have read of <hi>Antiſtines</hi> a Philoſopher, that deſired of his gods, (ſpeaking after the heatheniſh way) nothing in this world to make his life happy, but Contentment, and if he might have any thing that he would deſire to make his life happy, he would aske of them that he might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he might have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Socrates</hi> had to be able to bear any wrong any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:130622:61"/>
injuries that he met withall, and to continue in a quiet temper of ſpirit whatſoever befell him, for that was the temper of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> what ever befell him he continued the ſame man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever croſſe befell him no body could perceive any alteration of his ſpirit though never ſo great croſſes did befall him; this a Heathen did attain to by the ſtrength of nature, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of the Spirit: Now this <hi>Antiſtines</hi> ſaw ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in this ſpirit: As when God ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> what ſhall I give thee? he asked of God wiſdom; ſo ſaith he, if the gods ſhould put it to me to know what I would have, I would deſire this thing, that I might have the ſpirit of <hi>Socrates;</hi> he ſaw a great excellency that there was in this; and certainly a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may ſee abundance of excellency in it: I ſhall labour to ſet it out to you in this Sermon that you might be in love with this Grace of Contentment.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>by Contentment we come to give God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is due to him;</hi> it is a ſpeciall part of divine worſhip that we owe to God, if we be Content in a Chriſtian way, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as hath been opened to you, I ſay it is a ſpeciall part of the divine worſhip that the creature owes to the infinite Creator, in that I doe tender that reſpect that is due from me to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: The word that the Greeks have that ſignifies to worſhip, it is as much as to come and crouch before another, as a dog ſhould come crouching unto you, and be willing to lye down at your feet; ſo the creature in the apprehenſion of its own baſeneſſe, and the infinit excellency that there is in God above it; when it comes to worſhip God, it comes and crouches to this God, and it lyes down at the feet of God, then doth the Creature worſhip God. When you ſee a dog come crouching to you, and you can make him with holding your hand over him to lye down at your feet: then conſider thus ſhould you doe before the Lord, you ſhould come crouching to him, and lye down at his feet even upon your backs or bellies, to lye down in the duſt before him, ſo as to be willing that he ſhould doe with you what he will, as ſome times you may turn a dog this way or that way up and down with the hand, and there he lyes before you, according to your ſhewing him with your hand: So when the Creature ſhall come and lye down thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:130622:62"/>
the Lord, then a Creature worſhips God, doth tender you that worſhip that is due to God. Now in what diſpoſition of heart doe we thus crouch to God more, then when we have this Contentation in all conditions that God diſpoſed us unto? This is a crouching unto Gods diſpoſe, to be like the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when Chriſt ſaid it is not fit to give Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens meat to dogs, but (ſaith ſhe) the dogs have crums, I am a dog I confeſſe, I but let me have but a crum. And ſo when the ſoul ſhall be in ſuch a diſpoſition as to lye down and ſay, Lord I am but as a dog, yet let me have a crum, then doth it highly honour God. It may be ſome of you have not your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpread as others have, but God gives you crums, now ſaith the poor woman, dogs have crums, and when you can find your hearts thus ſubjecting unto God, to be but as a dog, and can be Contented and bleſſe God for any crum: I ſay this is a great worſhip of God, you worſhip God by this more then when you come to hear a Sermon, or ſpend halfe an hour, or an hour in prayer, or when you come to receive a Sacrament; Theſe are the acts of Gods worſhip, I but theſe are but externall acts of worſhip, to hear and pray and receive Sacraments: But now this is the Soul worſhip, to ſubject its ſelfe thus to God. You that often will worſhip God by Hearing, and Praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments, and yet afterwards will be froward and diſcontented, know that God regards not that worſhip, he will have the ſoul worſhip in this ſubjecting of the ſoul unto God. Obſerve it I beſeech you, in active obedience there we worſhip God by doing that that pleaſes God, but by paſſive obedience we doe as well worſhip God by being pleaſed with that that God doth. Now when I perform a duty I worſhip God, I doe what pleaſes God, why ſhould I not as well worſhip God when I am pleaſed with what God doth? As it was ſaid of Chriſts obedience, Chriſt was active in his paſſive obedience, and paſſive in his active obedience: So the Saints they are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their active obedience; they are firſt paſſive in the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace, and then active. And when they come to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience they are active, they put forth grace in active obedience, when they perform actions to God, then ſaith the Soul, Oh! that I could doe that that pleaſes God, when they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:130622:62"/>
come to ſuffer any croſſe, oh that what God doth might pleaſe me. I labour to doe what pleaſes God, and I labour that what God doth ſhall pleaſe me, here's a Chriſtian indeed that ſhall endeavour both theſe; now this is but one ſide of a Chriſtian to endeavour to doe what pleaſes God, but you muſt as well endeavour to be pleaſed with what God doth, and ſo you ſhall come to be a compleat Chriſtian when you can doe both, and that's the firſt thing in the excellency of this Grace of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Second thing in the opening of this excellency of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is, <hi>That in Contentment there is much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is much ſtrength of Grace, yea there is much beauty of Grace in Contentment, there is much exerciſe of Grace, ſtrength of Grace, and beauty of Grace, I put all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Much exerciſe of Grace,</hi> There is a compoſition of Grace in Contentment, there is faith, and there is humillity, and love, and there is patience, and there is wiſdom, and there is hope, all graces almoſt are compounded, it's an oyle that hath the ingredients of al kind of graces; &amp; therfore though you cannot ſee the particular grace yet in this oyl you have it all; God ſees the Graces of his Spirit exerciſed in a ſpeciall manner, and this pleaſes God at the heart to ſee the Graces of his Spirit exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In ſome one action that you do you may exerciſe ſome one grace eſpecially, but now in Contentment you exerciſe a great many graces at once.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>There is a great deal of ſtrength of Grace in Contentment,</hi> It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a great deal of ſtrength in the body, the body to be able to endure hard weather and whatſoever falls out, and yet not to be much altered by it; ſo it argues ſtrength of Grace to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: You that complain of weakneſſe of memory, of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of parts, you cannot do what others do in other things, but have you this gracious heart-contentment that hath been opened to you? I know that you have attained to ſtrength of Grace in this, when it is ſo ſpirituall as hath been opened to you in the explication of this point. As it is with a mans braine, if a man be diſtempered in his body, and hath many obſtructions in his body, hath an ill ſtomack, and his ſpleen
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:130622:63"/>
and liver obſtructed, and yet for all this his brain is not diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, it is an argument of a great ſtrength of brain, &amp; though there be many ill fumes that riſeth from his corrupt ſtomack, yet ſtill his brain is not diſtempered but he continues in the free exerciſe of the uſe of his reaſon and underſtanding; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may underſtand that this man hath a very ſtrong braine, that ſuch things ſhall not diſtemper him, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people that have a weak braine, if they do not diſgeſt but one meals meat, the fumes that do ariſe from their ſtomaks, doth diſtemper their brain &amp; makes them unfit for every thing, whereas you ſhall have others that have ſtrong heads, and ſtrong brains, though their ſtomacks be ill that they do not diſgeſt meat, yet ſtill they have the free uſe of their brain, this argues ſtrength: So it is in a mans ſpirit, you ſhall have many that have weak ſpirits, and if they have any ill fumes, if acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do befall them you ſhall preſently have them out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but you ſhall have other men that though things do fume up yet ſtill they keep in a ſteady way, and have the uſe of reaſon and of their graces, and poſſeſs their Souls with patience. As I remember it's reported of the Eagle, it's not like other fouls, other fouls when they are hungrie make an noiſe, but the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle is never heard to make an noiſe though it wants food, and it is from the magnitude of his ſpirit that it will not make ſuch complaints as other fowls will do when they want food, it is becauſe it is above hunger, and above thirſt: So it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a gracious magnitude of ſpirit that whatſoever befals it, yet it is not allwaies whining and complaining ſo as others are, but goes on ſtill in it's way and courſe, and bleſſes God, and keeps in a conſtant tenour whatſoever thing befals it, ſuch things as cauſes others to be dejected and fretted and vexed, and takes away all the comfort of their lives, it makes no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration at all in the ſpirits of theſe men and women, I ſay this is a ſign of a great deal of ſtrength of Grace.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It's alſo an argument of a great deale of beauty of Grace,</hi> It's a ſpeech that <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen once had, ſaith hee, when you go abroad into groves and woods, and there you ſee the talneſſe of the trees and their ſhadows, it ſtrikes a kind of awful fear of a deitie in you, and when you ſee the vaſt rivers and fountains,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:130622:63"/>
and deep waters that ſtrikes a kind of fear of a God in you, but (ſaith hee,) do you ſee a man that is quiet in tempeſts, and that lives happily in the mideſt of adverſities, why do not you worſhip that man the doth thinke him a man even to be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured that ſhal be quiet &amp; live a happy life though in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of adverſities. The glory of God appears here more then in any of his works; there is no works that God hath made, the Sun moon and ſtarrs &amp; all the world wherin ſo much of the glory of God doth appear, as in a man that lives quietly in the middeſt of adverſity. That was that that convinc'd the King, when he ſaw the three Children could walk in the mideſt of the firey furnace &amp; not be toucht, the King was mightily convinc'd by this, that ſurely their God was the great God indeed, &amp; that they were highly beloved of their God that could walk in the mid'ſt of the furnace &amp; not be toucht, whereas the others that came but to the mouth of the furnace were devoured, ſo when a Chriſtian can walk in the mid'ſt of firey trials, and not his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments findged, but have comfort and joy in the midiſt of al (as <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſtocks) can ſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (that wrought upon the jaylour) ſo it will convince men when they ſee the power of grace in the middeſt of afflictions, ſuch afflictions as would make others to rore under them, yet they can behave themſelves in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy manner; Oh it's the glory of a Chriſtian. It is that that is ſaid to be the glory of Chriſt, (for ſo by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it is thought to be meant of Chriſt) In <hi>Micah; 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. And this man</hi> (the text faith) <hi>ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land, and when he ſhall tread in our pallaces.</hi> This man ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land; for one to be in peace when there is no enemies it's no great matter, but ſaith the text when the Aſſyrian ſhal come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our land then this man ſhall be the peace; that is when all ſhal be in an hubbub and uprore yet then this man ſhal be peace. That's the tryall of grace when you find Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts to be peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into the land. You may think you find peace in Chriſt when you have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles, but is Chriſt your peace when the Aſſyrian comes into the land, when the enemy comes? Suppoſe you ſhould hear the enemy come marching to the City <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

the workes, and were plundering, what would be your peace? Jeſus Chriſt would be peace to the ſoul when the enemie come into the City, and into your houſes; If there be any of you that hath bin where the enemie hath come what hath bin the peace of your ſoules? That that's ſaid of Chriſt may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this grace of Contentment, when the Aſſyrian, the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, the enemies, when any affliction; trouble, diſtreſſe doth befall ſuch a heart then this grace of Contentment brings peace to the ſoul; at that time brings peace to the ſoul when the Aſſyrian comes into the land: The grace of Contentment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it's an excellent grace there's much beautie much ſtrength in it, there is a great deal of worth in this grace and therefore be in love with it,</p>

I appeal to you, you that are any way acquainted with the waies of God, have you not found this to be the way of God towards you; when you have been troubled for want perhaps of ſome ſpirituall comfort and your hearts were vext at it, you get nothing from God all that while; but now if you have got your heart into a quiet frame, and can ſay, well, it's fit the Lord ſhould do with his poor creatures what he will, I am under his feet, &amp; am reſolv'd to do what I can to honour him; and let him do with me what he will I will ſeek him as long as I live, I will be content with what God gives; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gives or no I will be content; yea are you in this frame (ſaith God) now you ſhall have comfort, now I will give you the mercy. A priſoner muſt not think to get off his fetters by pulling and tearing, he may gall his fleſh and rend it to the very bone, certainly he will be unfettered never the ſooner, but if he would have his fetters taken off he muſt quietly give up himſelf to ſome man to take them off; If a begger after be hath knockt once or twice at the door and you come not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is vext and troubled and thinks much that you let him ſtand a little while without any thing, you think that this beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not fit to receive an almes, but if you hear two or three beggers at your door, &amp; if you hear them out of your window ſay, let us be content to ſtay, perhaps they are buſie, it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. <hi>A Contented man whoſe eſtate is low, if God raiſes his eſtate he hath the love of God in it,</hi> and then its abundantly more ſweet then if he had it and his heart not Contented: for if he had not the love of God in it, for it may be God grants to a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented man his deſire, but he cannot ſay it is from love; if a man hath quieted his ſpirit firſt, and then God grant him his deſire, he may have more comfort in it, and more aſſurance that he hath the love of God in it.</p>
               <p>3. This Contentment is a comfort to a mans ſpirit in this, <hi>that it doth keep in his comforts, and keep out what ever may damp his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, or put out the light of them.</hi> I may compare this Grace of Contentment to a Marriners Lanthorn, a Marriner when he is at Sea let him have never ſo much proviſion in his ſhip, yet if he be thouſands of leagues from land, or in a rode that he ſhal not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:130622:66"/>
meet with a ſhip in three or four moneths, if he hath never a Lanthorn in his ſhip, nor nothing whereby he can keep a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light in a ſtorm he will be in a ſad condition, he would give a great deal to have a Lanthorn, or ſomething that may ſerve in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ead of it. When a ſtorm comes in the night, and he cannot have any light come above-board, but it is puft out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently his condition is very ſad, ſo many men can have the light of comfort when there is no ſtorm, but let there come but any affliction, any ſtorme upon them, their light is puft out preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what ſhall they doe now? when the heart is furniſhed with this Grace of Contentment, this Grace is as it were the Lanthorn, and it keeps comfort in the ſpirit of a man, light in the mideſt of a ſtorm and tempeſt. When you have a Lanthorn in the mideſt of a ſtorm you can carry a light every whereup and down the ſhip to the top of the Maſt if you will, and yet keep it light, ſo the comfort of a Chriſtian when it is inlivened with the Grace of Contentment, it may be kept light whatever ſtorms or tempeſts come, yet he can keep light in his ſoul, oh this helps thy comforts exceeding much.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>There's this excellency in Contentment that it fetches in the comfort of thoſe things we have not really in poſſeſſion,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many that have not outward things have more comfort then thoſe have that doe enjoy them themſelves: as now, a man, by diſtilling hearbs, though he hath not the hearbs themſelves, yet having the water that is diſtill'd out of them, he may en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy the benefit of the herbs, ſo though a man hath not the reall poſſeſſion of ſuch an outward eſtate, an outward comfort, yet he by the grace of Contentment may fetch it in to himſelf. By the art of Navigation we can fetch in the riches of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies to our ſelves, ſo by the art of Contentment we may fetch in the comfort of any condition to our ſelves, that is we may have that comfort by Contentment, that we ſhould have if we had the thing it ſelfe. There's a notable ſtory you have for this in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyrbus,</hi> one <hi>Sineus</hi> comes to him, and would very fain have had him deſiſt from the wars, and not war with the Romans, ſaith he to him, may it pleaſe your Majeſtie, it is reported that the Romans are very good men of warre, and if it pleaſe the gods we doe over-come them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:130622:67"/>
what benefit ſhall we have of that victory? <hi>Pyrbus</hi> anſwered him, we ſhall then ſtraight conquer all the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> with eaſe, ſaith <hi>Sineus</hi> indeed it is likely which your Grace ſpeaketh, but when we have won <hi>Italy</hi> will then our wars end? If the gods were pleaſed ſaid <hi>Pyrrbus,</hi> that the victory were atchieved, the way were then broad open for us to attain great conqueſts, for who would not afterwards go into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage?</hi> But (ſaith <hi>Sineus</hi>) when we have all in our hands what ſhall we doe in the end? then <hi>Pyrbus</hi> laughing, told him again, we will then be quiet, and take our caſe, and make feaſts every day, and be as merry one with another as we can poſſible, ſaith <hi>Sineus,</hi> what letteth us now to be as quiet, and merry together, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h we enjoy that preſently without further travell and trouble which we ſhould go ſeek for abroad, with ſuch ſhedding of blood, and ſo manifeſt danger, cannot you ſit down and be merry now? ſo a man may think if I had ſuch a thing, then I would have another, and if I had that then I ſhould have more, and what if you had got all you deſire? then you would be content, why? you may be content how without them: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our contentment doth not conſiſt in the getting of the thing we deſire, but in Gods faſhioning our ſpirits to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, there's ſome men that have not a foot of ground of their own, yet will live better then other men that are heirs to a great deal of Land. I have known it in the countrey ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that a man lives upon his own land, and yet lives very poorly, but you ſhall have another man that ſhall farm his Land, and yet by his good husbandry, and by his care ſhall live better ſometimes, then he that hath the Land of his own, ſo a man by this art of Contentment may live better without an eſtate then another man can live of an eſtate, oh it ads ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much to the comfort of a Chriſtian, and that I may ſhew it farther, there is more comfort even in the Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment then there is in any poſſeſſions whatſoever, a man hath more comfort in being content without a thing, then he can have in the thing that he in a diſcontened way doth deſire.</p>
               <p>You think if I had ſuch a thing then I ſhould be content. I ſay there is more good in Contentment, then there is in the thing that you would faln have to cure your diſcontent, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:130622:67"/>
that I ſhall open in divers particulars, as thus.</p>
               <p>1 I would fain have ſuch a thing, and then I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but if I had it then it were but the Creature that did help to my Contentment, but now it's the Grace of God in my ſoul that makes me content, and ſurely it is better to be Content with the Grace of God in my ſoul, then with the enjoying of an outward comfort.</p>
               <p>2. If I had ſuch a thing indeed my eſtate might be better, but my ſoul would not be better, but by Contentment my ſoul is better, that would not be bettered by an eſtate, or lands, or friends; but Contentment makes my ſelfe to be better, and therefore Contentment is a better portion then the thing is that I would fain have to be my portion.</p>
               <p>3. If I get Content by having my deſire ſatisfied, that's but ſelfe-love, but when I am Contented with the hand of God, and am willing to be at his diſpoſe, that comes from my love to God, in having my deſire ſatisfied there I am contented through ſelfe love, but through the Grace of Contentment I come to be contented out of love to God, and is it not better to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a principle of love to God, then from a principle of ſelfe-love?</p>
               <p>4. If I am contented becauſe I have that that I have a deſire to, perhaps I am contented in that one particular, but that one particular doth not furniſh me with Contentment in another thing, perhaps I may grow more dainty and nice, and froward in other things; if you give children what they would have in ſome things, they grow ſo much the more coy and dainty, and diſcontented if they have not other things that they would have, but if I have once over-come my heart, and am conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Grace of God in my heart, then this doth not content me only in a particular but in generall, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals me. I am diſcontented, and would fain have ſuch a thing, and afterward I have it: now doth this prepare me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in other things? no, but when I have gotten this Grace of Contentment I am prepared to be contented in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and thus you ſee that Contentment doth bring comfort to a mans life, fils a mans life full of comfort in this world; yea, the truth is, it is even a Heaven upon earth, why, what is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:130622:68"/>
Heaven, but the reſt and quiet of a mans ſpirit; what's the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall thing that is in Heaven, but reſt and joy, that makes, the life of Heaven, there's reſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy, and ſatisfaction in God, ſo its here in a contented ſpirit, there's reſt and joy, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in God: In Heaven there's ſinging prayſes to God, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented heart is alwayes prayſing and bleſſing God, thou haſt Heaven while thou art upon earth when thou haſt a contented ſpirit, yea, in ſome regards it's better then Heaven. How is that you will ſay? there is ſome kind of honour that God hath in it, and ſome excellency that he hath not in Heaven, and that's this.</p>
               <p>In heaven there is no overcoming of temptations, they are not put to any tryals by afflictions, there in heaven they have exerciſe of grace, but they have nothing but incouragement to it, &amp; inded thoſe that are there their grace is perfect and in that they doe excel us; but there is nothing to croſſe their grace, they have no tryals at all to tempt them to doe contrary, but now for a man or woman to be in the midſt of afflictions, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and troubles, and yet to have grace exerciſed, and yet to be ſatisfied in God and Chriſt and in the word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the mideſt of all they ſuffer, this may ſeeme to be an honour that God hath from us, that he hath not from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Heaven. Is it ſo much for one that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that hath nothing elſe but good from God, hath nothing to try them, no temptations, is that ſo much for them to be prayſing and bleſſing God, as for the poore ſoule that is in the mideſt of tryals and temtations, and afflictions and troubles? For this ſoule to go on prayſing, and bleſſing, and ſerving God; I ſay it is an excellency that thou ſhall not have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God ſhal not have this kind of glory from thee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore be contented, and priſe this Contentment, and be willing to live in this world as long as God ſhall pleaſe, and doe not think, Oh that I were delivered from all theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and troubles here in this world, if thou were, then thou ſhouldeſt have more eaſe to thy ſelfe: but here's a way of honouring God, and manifeſting the excellency of Grace here when thou art in this conflict of temptation that God ſhall not have from thee in Heaven, and therefore be ſatisfied and

ungodly men, that God when he comes with ten thouſand of Angels ſhall come to puniſh for all their ungodly deeds that they doe, and thoſe that ſpeake ungodly things againſt them; Theſe ungodly ones are murmurers, murmurers in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are put in the fore front of ungodly ones, it's a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Scripure, that the Lord when he ſpeaks of ungodly ones puts murmurers in the very fore-front of all, you had need look to your ſpirits, you may ſee that this murmuring, which is the vice contrarie to this Contentment is not ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you think, you think you are not ſo ungodly as others, becauſe you doe not ſweare and drink as others doe, but you may be ungodly in murmuring, it's true there is no ſin but ſom ſeedes and remayners of it are in thoſe that are godly, but when they are under the power of this ſin of murmuring, it doth convince them to be ungodly, as well as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of drunkenneſſe, or whordome, or any other ſin, God will look upon you as ungodly for this ſin as well as for any ſin whatſoever. This one Scripture ſhould make the heart ſhake at the thought of the ſin of murmuring.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as it's made a brand of ungodly men, ſo you ſhal find in Scripture <hi>that God accounts it rebellion,</hi> that is contrary to the worſhip that there was in contentedneſſe: that's worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, crowching to God and falling down before him, even as a dog that would crowch when you hould a ſtaffe over him, but a murmuring heart it's a rebellious heart, and that you ſhall find if you compare two Scriptures together, they are both in the book of <hi>Numb. 16. 41. But on the morrow</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>all the congregation of the Children of Iſraell murmured againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, ye have killed the people of the Lord.</hi> They all murmured, now compare this with the <hi>Chap. 17. &amp; verſ. 10.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:130622:72"/>
and when diſcontentment comes it grows to murmuring, and you can go into no houſe almoſt but there is murmuring when men are diſcontent, ſo that within a little while it breaks forth into ſedition or rebellion.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:130622:72"/>
Jeſus Chriſt can never be known in his beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency till the ſoul know that. I doe not ſpeak what ſecret work of the Holy Ghoſt there may be in the Soul, but before the Soul can actually apply Jeſus Chriſt to its ſelfe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but it muſt come to know the evill of ſinne, and the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt: there may be a ſeed of faith put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, but the Soul muſt firſt know Chriſt, and know ſin, and be made ſenſible of it. Now how contrary is this ſin of murmuring to any ſuch work of God; hath God made me ſee the dreadfull evill of ſin, and made my ſoul to be ſenſible of the evill of ſin as the greateſt burden? how can I be then ſo much troubled for every little affliction? certainly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. Yea it's mighty contrary to the ſight of the infinit excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the things of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. What am I that ſoul that the Lord hath diſcovered ſuch infinit excellency of Jeſus Chriſt to, and yet ſhall I thinke ſuch a little affliction to be ſo grievous to me, when I have had the ſight of ſuch glory in Chriſt that is more worth then ten thouſand worlds? (for ſo will a true convert ſay) oh the Lord at ſuch a time hath given me that ſight of Chriſt that I would not be without for ten thouſand thouſand worlds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hath God given thee that, and wilt thou be diſcontent for a trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in compariſon to that?</p>
               <p>3. A third work when God brings the Soul home to himſelf, it is by the taking the heart off from the Creature, the diſinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the heart from all creature comforts, that's the third work ordinarily that the Soul may perceive of its ſelfe. It's true, Gods work may be altogether in the ſeeds in him, but in the ſeverall actings of the Soul in turning to God it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe things in it, the diſingagement of the heatt from the Creature, that's the calling of the Soul from the world, <hi>whom the Lord hath called he hath juſtified,</hi> what's the calling of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:130622:73"/>
Soul but this, the Soul that before was ſeeking for Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, and cleaving to the Creature, now the Lord cals the Soul out of the world, and ſaith, oh Soul, thy happineſſe is not here, thy reſt is not here, thy happineſſe is elſe where, and thy heart muſt be looſned from all theſe things that are here below in the world, and this is the work of God in the Soul to diſingage the heart from the Creature, and how contrary is a murmuring heart to ſuch a thing; a thing that is glued to another you cannot take off, but you muſt rend it, ſo it's a ſign thy heart is glued to the world, that when God would take thee off, thy heart rends, if God by an affliction ſhould come to take any thing in the world from thee, if thou canſt part from it with eaſe without rending, it's a ſign then that thy heart is not glewed to the world.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth work of God in the converting of a ſinner, is this, the caſting of the ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all its good: I ſee Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel the Fountain of all good, and God out of free Grace tendering him to me for life, and for ſalvation, and now my ſoul caſts its ſelfe, rouls its ſelfe upon the infinit Grace of God in Chriſt for all good, now haſt thou done ſo? hath God converted thee, and drawn thee to his Son to caſt thy ſoul upon him for all thy good, and yet thou diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for the want of ſome little matter in a creature comfort? art thou he that hath caſt thy Soul upon Jeſus Chriſt for all good? as he ſaith in another caſe, is this thy faith?</p>
               <p>5. The Soul is ſubdued to God. And then it comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt as a King, to rule, to order, and diſpoſe of him how he pleaſes, and ſo the heart is ſubdued unto God. Now how oppoſite is a murmuring diſcontented heart to a heart ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to Jeſus Chriſt as a King, and receiving him as a Lord to rule and diſpoſe of him as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>6. There is in the work of thy turning to God the giving up of thy ſelfe to God in an everlaſting Covenant, as thou takeſt Chriſt the head of the Covenant to be thine, ſo thou giveſt up thy ſelfe to Chriſt; In the work of Converſion there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Soul wholly to God in an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be his, haſt thou ever ſurrendred up thy ſelfe to God in an overlaſting Covenant? then certainly this thy fretting, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:130622:73"/>
heart is mighty oppoſite to it, certainly thou forgetteſt this Covenant of thine, and the Reſignation of thy ſelfe up to God, it would be of marvellous helpe to you to humble your Souls when you are in a murmuring condition; if you could but obtain ſo much liberty of your own ſpirits as to look back to ſee what the work of God was in converting you, there is nothing would prevaile more then to think of that. I am now in a murmuring diſcontented way, but how did I feel my ſoul working when God did turn my Soul to himſelfe? oh how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite is this to that work, and how unſeeming? oh what ſhame and confuſion would come upon the ſpirits of men and women, if they could but compare the work of corruption in their murmuring and diſcontent, with the work of God that was upon their Souls in converſion; now we ſhould labour to keep the work of God upon our Souls that was at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for Converſion muſt not be only at one inſtant at firſt: men are deceived in this, if they think their Converſion is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed meerly at firſt, thou muſt be in a way of converſion to God all the dayes of thy life, and therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, except ye be converted and become as little children: <hi>Ye be Converted,</hi> why, were they not converved before? yes they were converted, but they were ſtill to continue the work of Converſion all the dayes of their lives, and what work of God there is at the firſt Converſion it is to abide afterwards. As thus, alwayes there muſt abide ſome ſight and ſenſe of ſin, it may be not in the way which you had, which was rather a preparation then any thing elſe, but the ſight and ſence of ſin it is to continue ſtill, that is, you are ſtill to be ſenceable of the burden of ſin as it is againſt the Holineſſe, and Goodneſſe, and mercy of God unto thee, and the ſight of the excellency of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is to continue, and thy calling out of the Creature: and thy caſting of thy Soul upon Chriſt, and thy receiving Chriſt as a King, ſtill receive him day by day, and the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy heart, and the ſurrendring of thy ſelfe up to God in a way of Covenant; now if this were but daily continued there would be no ſpace nor time for murmuring to work upon thy heart, that's the fourth Particular.</p>

So I may ſay to a Chriſtian, art thou the Kings Son, the Son, the Daughter, of the King of Heaven, and yet ſo diſquieted and troubled, and vext at every little thing that falls out? as if a Kings Son ſhould cry out he is undone for looſing a bable, what an unworthy thing were this: So doeſt thou, thou crieſt out as if thou wert undone and yet a Kings Son, thou that ſtandeſt in ſuch relation to God, as unto a father, thou doeſt diſhonour thy father in this; as if ſo be either he had not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or not power, or not mercy enough to provide for thee.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to Jeſus Chriſt, thou art the ſpouſe of Chriſt,</hi> what! one married to Jeſus Chriſt &amp; yet troubled and diſcontented? haſt thou not enough in him? doth not Chriſt ſay to his ſpouſe, as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah, 1 Sam.</hi> 1. 8. Am not I better to thee then ten ſons? So doth not Chriſt thy husband ſay to thee, Am not I better to thee then thouſands of riches and comforts, ſuch comforts as thou murmureſt for want of, hath not God given thee his Son and will he not with him give thee all things? hath the love of God bin to thee to give thee his Son in way of marriage? why art thou diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and murmuring? conſider thy relation to Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:130622:74"/>
as thou art a ſpouſe and married to him, his perſon is thine, and ſo all the riches of Jeſus Chriſt is thine, as the riches of a husband are the wives, and though there are ſome husbands ſo vile as the wives may be forced to ſue for maintainance; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Jeſus Chriſt will never deny maintainance to his ſpouſe, it's a diſhonour for a husband to have the wife go whining up and down; what, thou art macht with Chriſt &amp; art his ſpouſe, and wilt thou murmure now and be diſcontented in thy ſpirit? You ſhall obſerve among thoſe that are newly matched, when there is diſcontent between the wife and the husband, their friends will ſhake their heads and ſay, they do not meet with that that they did expect, ye ſee ever ſince they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together how the man looks, and the woman looks, they are not ſo chearly as they were wont to be, ſurely (ſay they) it is like to prove an ill match. But it's not ſo here, it ſhall not be ſo between thee and Chriſt: Oh Jeſus Chriſt doth not love to ſee his ſpouſe to have a lowring countenance: no man loves to ſee diſcontentment in the face of his wife, ſurely Chriſt doth not love to ſee diſcontentment in the face of his ſpouſe.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Thou ſtandeſt in relation to Chriſt</hi> not only as a ſpouſe, but as <hi>a member<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou art bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> and to have a member of Jeſus Chriſt to be in ſuch a condition, it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unworthy.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>He is thy elder brother likewiſe, and ſo thou art a co-heir with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Spirit of God,</hi> thou art the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt is thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, it is he that is appointed to conveigh all comfort from the Father and the Son, to the Souls of his people. And art thou the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and doth he dwell in thee, and yet for all that thou murmure for every little matter.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>The relation that thou ſtandeſt in to the Angels, thou art made one body with them,</hi> for ſo Chriſt hath joyned principalities and powers with his Church, they are Miniſtring Spirits for good of his people, to ſupply what they need, and thou, and they are joyned together, and Chriſt is the head of you and Angels.</p>

with Jeſus Chriſt, and if they be happy you muſt needs be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; Oh how beneath a Chriſtian is a murmuring Spirit if he conſiders his relations in which he ſtands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Chriſtian ſhould conſider, <hi>That murmuring and diſcontentedneſſe is below the high dignities that God hath put upon him:</hi> Doe but conſider the high dignytie that God hath put upon thee; the meaneſt Chriſtian in the world is a lord of heaven and earth; he hath made us Kings unto himſelfe, Kings unto God, not Kings unto men to rule over them, and yet I ſay every Chriſtian is lord of heaven and earth, yea of life and death. That is, as Chriſt he is Lord of all, ſo he hath made thoſe that are his members to be lords of all, all are yours ſaith the Apoſtle, even life and death, every thing is yours, it's a very ſtrange expreſſion that death ſhould be theirs, death is yours, that is; you are as it were lords over it, you have that that ſhall make death to be your ſervant, your ſlave, even death it's ſelf, your greateſt enemies are turned to be your ſlaves; faith makes a Chriſtian to be as lord over all, to be lifted up in ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellency above all creatures that ever God made except the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yea and in ſome reſpect above them, I ſay the pooreſt Chriſtian that lives is raiſed to an eſtate above all the creatures in the world except Angels, yea and above them in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects too, and yet diſcontented! that thou who wert as a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of hell, and might have been ſcorching and yelling and ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing there to all eternity, yet that God ſhould raiſe thee to have a higher excellency in thee then there is in all the works of creation that ever he made except Angels, and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are in thy condition, yea and thou art nearer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature then the Angels, becauſe thy nature is joyned in an hypoſtaticall union to the Divine nature, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thy nature is more honoured then the nature of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And the death of Chriſt is thine, he dyed for thee and not for the Angels, and therefore thou art like to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels in divers reſpects: yea thou that art in ſuch an eſtate as this is, thou that art ſet apart to the end that God might manifeſt to all eternity what the infinite power of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is able to raiſe a creature too; for that's the condition of a Saint, a beleever, his condition is ſuch as he is ſet apart to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:130622:75"/>
end that God might manifeſt to all eternity what his infinite power is able to do to make the creature happy, art thou in ſuch a condition? Oh how low and beneath this condition is a murmuring and diſcontented heart for want of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts here in this world: How unſeemly is it that thou ſhouldeſt be a ſlave to every croſs, that every affliction ſhal be able to ſay to thy ſoul bow down to us: We accounted that a great ſlavery, when men would ſay to our ſouls bow down: As the cruel Prelats were wont do do in impoſing things upon mens conſciences, they did in effect ſay, let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down to us, that we may tread upon them; that is the greateſt ſlavery in the world that one man ſhould ſay to another, let your conſciences, your ſouls bow down that we may tread upon them, but wilt thou ſuffer every affliction to ſay bow down that we may tread upon thee? truly it's ſo, when thy heart is overcome with murmuring and diſcontent: Know that thoſe afflictions which have cauſed thee to murmur have ſaid to thee bow down that we may tread upon thee: Nay not afflictions, but the very Devill doth prevail againſt you in this: Oh! how beneath is this to the happy eſtate that God hath raiſed a Chriſtian unto; what? The Son of a King, ſhal he have every baſe fellow to come and bid him bow down that he may tread upon his neck? Thus doeſt thou in every affliction: The affliction, the croſſe and trouble that doth befall thee, ſaith bow down that we may come and tread upon thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Murmuring it's below the Spirit of a Chriſtian.</hi> Below his Spirit, the Spirit of every Chriſtian ſhould be like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Father; every father loves to ſee his ſpirit in his child, loves to ſee his image, not his image of his body onely, to ſay here's a child for all the world like the father, but he hath the Spirit of his father too: A father that is a man of Spirit loves to ſee his Spirit in his child, rather then the feature of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Oh the Lord that is our Father loves to ſee his Spirit in us: Great men loves to ſee great Spirits in their children, and the great God loves to ſee a great Spirit in his Children, we are one Spirit with God, and with Chriſt, and one Spirit with the Holy-Ghoſt therefore we ſhould have a Spirit that might manifeſt the glory of the Father Son &amp; Holy-Ghoſt in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:130622:76"/>
that's the Spirit of a Chriſtian indeed. The Spirit of a Chriſtian ſhould be a lyon like Spirit, as Jeſus Chriſt is the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> (ſo he is calld) ſo we ſhould manifeſt ſomewhat of the Lyon-like Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lyon-like Spirit in paſſing through all afflictions and troubles whatſoever without any murmuring againſt God. When he came to drink that bitter cup, and even the dregs of it, he prayed indeed to God that if it were poſſible it might paſſe from him, but preſently, not my will, but thy will be done: As ſoone as ever he did mention the paſſing of the cup from him, though it were the moſt dreadfull cup that ever was drunke ſince the world began, yet at the mentioning of it, not my will but thy will be done; here Chriſt ſhewed a Lyon-like Spirit in going through al kind of afflictions whatſoever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any murmuring againſt God in them; now a murmuring Spirit is a baſe dejected Spirit, croſſe and contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Chriſtian, and it's very baſe. I remember that the Heathens accouned it very baſe, <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth report of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine people that did uſe to manifeſt their diſdaine to men that were overmuch dejected by any affliction, they did condemne them to this puniſhment; to wear womens cloaths all their dayes, or ſuch a ſpace of time at leaſt they ſhould go in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cloths in token of ſhame and diſgrace to them becauſe they have ſuch effeminate ſpirits, they thought it againſt a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Spirit, and therefore ſeeing they did un-man themſelves they ſhould go as women, now ſhall they account it an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Spirit, to be overmuch dejected in afflictions; and ſhall not a Chriſtian account it an unchriſtian like Spirit to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much dejected by any affliction whatſoever? I remember ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compares murmuring Spirits to children when they are weaning, what a deal of ſtir have you with your children when you wean them, how froward and vexing are they: So when God would wean thee from ſome outward comforts in this world, Oh how fretting and diſcontented art thou! Children will not ſleep themſelves, nor let their mothers ſleep when they are weaning; and ſo when God would wean us from the world, and we fret, vex, and murmure, this is a childiſh ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:130622:76"/>Fourthly, <hi>It's below the profeſſion of a Chriſtian,</hi> The profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Chriſtian, what's that? A Chriſtians profeſſion is to be dead to the world and and to be alive to God, that's his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to have his life to be hid with Chriſt in God, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelfe in God, what is this thy profeſſion? and yet if thou haſt not every thing that thou wouldeſt have to murmure and be diſcontent, thou doeſt in that even deny thy profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>It is below that ſpecial Grace of faith,</hi> faith is that that doth overcome the world, it is that that makes all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God to be ours, now when thou tookeſt upon thee the profeſſion of Religion did God ever promiſe thee that thou ſhouldeſt live at eaſe, and quiet, and have no trouble? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, what is this thy faith? what did I ever promiſe thee (ſaith he) that thou ſhouldeſt ever flouriſh in the world? art thou a Chriſtian to that end? and is this thy faith? I never made any ſuch promiſe to thee when thou tookeſt upon thee to be a Chriſtian: Oh it's mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thy profeſſion, thou haſt never a promiſe for this, that thou ſhouldeſt not have ſuch an affliction upon thee: And a Chriſtian ſhould live by his faith; it is ſaid that the juſt doth live by faith, now thou ſhouldeſt not look after any other life but the life that thou haſt by faith, now thou haſt no ground for thy faith to beleeve that thou ſhouldeſt be delivered out of ſuch an affliction, and then why ſhouldeſt thou account it ſuch a great evill to be under ſuch an affliction? Certainly that good that we have in the ground for our faith, it is enough to content our hearts here, and to all eternity: A Chriſtian ſhould be ſatisfied with that that God hath made to be the object of his faith, the object of his faith is high enough to ſatisfie his ſoul, were it capeable of a thouſand times more then it is: Now if thou mayeſt have the object of thy faith full thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to content thy ſoul: And know that when thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſuch and ſuch comforts, if thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt but think thus, God did never promiſe me that I ſhould have theſe comforts, and at this time, and in ſuch a way as I would have, but I am diſcontented becauſe I have not theſe which God did never yet promiſe me, and therefore I ſin much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:130622:77"/>
againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the grace of faith.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing, It's below the hopes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Oh! the moſt glorious things that the Saints hope for.</p>
               <p>And againſt the helps that Chriſtians have, Chriſtians have great helps that may help them againſt murmuring.</p>
               <p>And it is againſt that which God expects from Chriſtians. God he expects other manner of things from them then this.</p>
               <p>Yea, and it is below that that God hath from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe things I ſhall open at another time.</p>

Chriſtians, when God expects this from you, for you not ſo much as to have attained to contentedneſſe under afflictions, oh this is beneath the expectation of God from you.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>It is below that that God hath had from other Chriſtians,</hi> others have not only bin contented with little croſſes, but they have Triumphed under great afflictions, they have ſuffered the ſpoiling of their goods with joy, reade but the later part of the 11. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and you ſhall find what great things God hath had from his people, and therfore not to be content with ſmaler croſſes this muſt needs be a great evill.</p>
               <p>The Sixth evill that there is in a murmuring ſpirit is this, <hi>By murmuring you undoe your prayers, for it is exceeding contrary to the prayers that you make unto God:</hi> When you come to prayer to God, you acknowledge his Soveraignity over you, you come there to profeſſe your ſelves to be at Gods diſpoſe, what doe you pray for except you acknowledge that you are at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, except you wil ſtand (as it were) at his diſpoſe never come to petition to him, if you will come to petition him and yet will be your own carver you go croſſe to your prayers, to come as if you would beg your bread at your Fathers gates every day, and yet you muſt do what you liſt, this is the undoing of the prayers of a Chriſtian. I remember I have read of <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> that ſpeaking concerning <hi>Peter</hi> that denyed his maſter, (ſaith he) <hi>Peter</hi> forgot his Pater-noſter, for that was <hi>hallowed be thy name, and thy kingdome come,</hi> ſo we may ſay, when you have murmuring and diſcontented hearts you forget your prayers, you forget what you have prayed for, for you muſt make the Lords prayr to be as a pattern for your prayrs though you ſay not alwaies the ſame words, what do you pray <hi>but give us this day our dayly bread,</hi> for that's Chriſts intention that we ſhould have that as a patterne, and is a directory (as it were) how to make our prayers, now God doth not teach any of you to pray, Lord give me ſo much a year, or let me have ſuch kind of cloath, and ſo many diſhes at my table, Chriſt doth not teach you to pray ſo, but he teaches us to pray <hi>Lord give us our bread</hi> ſhewing that you ſhould be content with a little, what have you not bread to eate? I hope there's none of you here but have that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where did Chriſt teach us to pray Lord give us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſo long a time, no, but if we have bread for this day Chriſt would have us content: Therefore when we murmure becauſe we have not ſo much variety as others have, we do (as it were, forget our <hi>Pater-n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ster;</hi> It's againſt our prayers, we do not in our lives hold forth the acknowledgement of the Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aignity of God over us as we ſeem to acknowledg in our prayrs, therefore when at any time you find your hearts murmuring then do but reflect upon your ſelves and think thus, is this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my prayers, wherein I held forth the Soveraigne power and Authority that God had over me?</p>
               <p>The ſeventh thing that I adde for the evill of diſcontentment is the wofull effects that comes to a diſcontented heart from murmuring, Ile name you five, there are five evill effects that comes from a murmuring ſpirit.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>By murmuring and diſcontent in your hearts, you come to looſe a great deale of time,</hi> how many times doe men and women when they are diſcontended let their thoughts run, and are muſing and contriving (through their preſent diſcontendedneſſe) then let their diſcontended thoughts be working in them, for ſome hours together, and they ſpend their time in vain. When you are alone you ſhould ſpend your time in holy meditation, but you are ſpending your time in diſcontented thoughts, you who complain that you cannot meditate, you cannot thinke on good things, but if you begin to think of them a little, preſently your thoughts are off from them, but if you be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with any thing, then you can go alone, and muſe, and roul things up and down in your thoughts to feed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humour: Oh labour to ſee this evill effect of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, the loſing of your time.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It doth unfit you for duty,</hi> a man or woman that is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame, you may turn ſuch a one to any thing at any time, he is fit for to go to God at any time, but when one is in a diſcontented condition, then a man or woman is exceeding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:130622:78"/>
unfit for the ſervice of God. And it cauſes many diſtractions in duty, it unfits for duty, and when you come to performe duties, oh the diſtractions that are in your duties, when your ſpirits are diſcontented; when you hear of any ill news from Sea and cannot bear it, or of any il from a friend, or any loſſe or croſſe, oh what diſtractions doe they cauſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties. When you ſhould be in injoying communion with God, you are diſtracted in your thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the croſſe that hath befallen you, whereas had you but a quiet ſpirit, though there ſhould great croſſes befall you, yet they would never hinder you in the performance of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Conſider What wicked riſings of heart, &amp; reſolutions of ſpirit there are many times in a diſcontented fit.</hi> In ſome diſcontented fits the heart riſes againſt God, and againſt others and ſometimes hath even deſperate reſolutions what to do to help themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Lord ſhould have ſuffered you to have done, (ſometimes in a diſcontented fit) what you had thought to doe, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miſery had you brought upon your ſelves, oh it was a mercy of God that did ſtop you, had not God ſtopt you, but let you go on when you thought to helpe your ſelves this way and the other way, oh it had been ill with you, doe you but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe riſings of heart and wicked reſolutions that ſometimes you have had in a diſcontented mood, and learn to be humbled upon that.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Vnthankefulneſſe that's an evill and a wicked effect that comes from diſcontent.</hi> Vnthankfulneſſe the Scripture doth ranke among very great ſins. For men and women that are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent though they enjoy many mercies from God, yet they are thankfull for none of them for this is the vile nature of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment to leſſen every mercy of God; to make thoſe mercies they have from God to be as nothing to them, becauſe they have not what they would have. Sometimes it's ſo even in ſpirituall things, if they have not all they would have, the comforts that they would have, then what they have is nothing to them, doe you think that God will take this well? If you ſhould give a friend, a kinſman, a purſſe of money to go and trade withall, and he ſhould come and ſay what doe you give
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:130622:79"/>
me? they are but a few counters, they will doe me no good: you cannot bear this at his hand, if he ſhould doe ſo becauſe he hath not as much money as he would: ſo for you to be ready to ſay all that God hath given me is nothing worth, will doe me no good, they are but counters; though they are the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous graces of Gods Spirit that are more worth then thouſands of worlds, yet for you to ſay they are nothing, they are but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, and all is but in hypocriſie, all counterfeit, Oh what an unthankful thing is this; the graces of Gods Spirit are nothing to a diſcontented heart that hath not all that it would have, and ſo for outward bleſſings, though God hath given you health of body, and ſtrength, and hath given you ſome competency for your family, ſome way of lively-hood, yet becauſe you are diſappointed in ſomwhat that you would have, therefore all is nothing unto you, Oh what unthankfullneſſe is here? God expects that every day you ſhould ſpend ſome time in bleſſing his name for what mercy he hath granted to you, there's not any one of you who are in the loweſt condition but you have abundance of mercies to bleſſe God for, but diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe makes them nothing. It's an excellent ſpeech that I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath, (ſaith he) this is the Rhetorick of the Spirit of God, (it's a very fine ſpeech of his) to extenuate evill things, and to amplyfie good things, if there falls out a croſſe to make the croſſe to be but little, but if there be a mercy to make the mercy to be great, as thus, if there be a croſſe, if the Spirit of God prevails in the heart, ſuch a man or woman will wonder that it is no greater, and will bleſſe God that though there be ſuch a croſſe yet that it is no more, that's the worke of the Spirit of God; and if there be a mercy, wonders at Gods goodneſſe that God granted ſo great a mercy: The Spirit of God extenuats evils, and croſſes, and doth magnyfie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfie all mercies, and makes all mercies ſeem to be great, and all afflictions ſeem to be little. But ſaith he the Devill goes quit contrary, the rhetorick of the devill is quit otherwiſe, he doth leſſen Gods mercies, and amplyfy evill things, as thus, a godly man wonders at his croſſe that it is no more, a wicked man wonders his croſſe is ſo much, Oh ſaith he none was ever ſo afflicted as I am: If there be a croſſe, the Devill puts the ſoul
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:130622:79"/>
upon muſing on it, and making it greater then it is, and ſo it brings diſcontent: And then on the other ſide, if there be a mercy, then it's the Rhetorick of the Devill to leſſen the mercy, I indeed (ſaith he) the thing is a good thing, but what is it, it is no great matter, and for all this I may be miſerable. Thus the Rhetorick of Satan doth leſſen Gods mercies, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe afflictions: And for this I'le give you a notable example that we have in Scripture, it is the example of <hi>Korah, Dathan &amp; Abiram,</hi> In <hi>Numb. 16. 12, 13. And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſent to call</hi> Dathan, &amp; Abiram, <hi>the ſons of</hi> Eliab: <hi>which ſaid we will not come up: Is it a ſmal thing that thou haſt brought us up out of a Land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderneſs, except thou make thy ſelfe altogether a Prince over us?</hi> Mark, they ſlighted the land that they were going unto, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was the Land that God promiſed them that ſhould flow with milk and honey: But mark here their diſcontentedneſſe, becauſe they met with ſome troubles in the wilderneſſe, oh it was to ſlay them, they make their affliction in the wilderneſſe to be greater then it was, Oh it was to kill them, though it were indeed to carry them to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But now their deliverance from Egypt though it was a great mercy, they made that mercy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for ſay they you have brought us out of a land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with mith milk and honey, what land was that? It was the land of Egypt, the land of their bondage, but they call it a land that flowed with milk and honey, though it were the land of their moſt cruell and unſupportable bondage; whereas they ſhould have bleſſed God as long as they had liv'd for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods delivering them out of the land of Egypt, yet meeting with ſome croſſe they make their deliverance from Egypt no mercy, no, it was rather a miſery to them, Oh (ſay they) Egypt was a land that flowed with milk and honey. Oh what baſeneſſe is there in a diſcontented ſpirit! a diſcontented ſpirit out of envy to Gods grace will make mercies that are great to be little, yea to be none at all. Would one ever have thought that ſuch a word ſhould have come from the mouth of an Iſraelite that had bin under bondage and cried under it, and yet when they meet with a little croſſe in their may to ſay, you have brought us out of the land that floweth with milk and honey, to ſay they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:130622:80"/>
were better before then now, and yet before they could not be contented neither; this is the uſuall unthankfull expreſſion of a diſcontented heart: And it is ſo with us now when we meet with any croſſe in our eſtates, any taxations and trouble, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any among you have bin where the enemy hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, you are ready to ſay, we had plenty before and we are now brought to a condition of hardſhip, we were better before when we had the Prelats and others to domineere, and ſo we in danger our ſelves to be brought into that bondage again; oh let us take heed of this, of a diſcontented heart, there is this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſed fruit of diſcontent to make men and women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull for all the mercies God hath granted to them, and this is a ſore and greivious evil.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>There's this evil effect in murmuring, it cauſes ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſpirit,</hi> they that murmur and are diſcontent, are lyable to temptations, to ſhift for them ſelves in ſinfull and ungodly waies, diſcontent is the ground of ſhifting courſes and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waies. How many of you may have your conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you of this, that you in the time of your afflictions have ſought to ſhift for your ſelves by waies that have been ſinfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and your diſcontent was the bottom and ground of it? If you would avoid ſhiftings for your ſelves by wicked waies, labour to mortifie this ſin of diſcontent, to mortifie it at the root.</p>
               <p>The eight evill that there is in murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There is a great deal of folly, extream folly in a diſcontented heart, it's a fooliſh ſin.</hi> I ſhall open the folly of it in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It takes away the preſent comfort of what you have, becauſe you have not ſomwhat that you would have.</hi> What a fooliſh thing is this that becauſe I have not what I would have, I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of what I have: Doe not you account this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your children, you give them ſome victuals and they are not contented, perhaps (they ſay) it's not enough, they cry for more, and if you doe not preſently give them more they will throw away that they have, and though you account that folly in your children, yet you deal thus with God, God gives you many mercies, but you ſee others have more mercies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:130622:80"/>
then you and therefore you cry for more; I but God gives you not what you would have and upon that you throw away what you have, is not this folly in your hearts? It is unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. There's a great deal of folly in diſcontentment, for <hi>by all your diſcontent you cannot helpe your ſelves,</hi> you cannot get any thing by it. Who can by taking any carking care <hi>adde one cubit to his ſtature, or make one hair that is white to be black?</hi> You may vex and trouble your ſelves but you can get nothing by it. Doe you think that the Lord will come in a way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ever a whit the ſooner becauſe of the murmuring of your ſpirits, Oh no, but mercy will be rather deferred the longer for it, though the Lord were before in a way of mercy, yet this diſtemper of your hearts were enough to put him out of his courſe of mercy, and though he had thoughts that you ſhould have the thing before, yet now you ſhall not have it. If you had a mind to give ſuch a thing to your child yet if you ſee him in a diſcontented freting way you will not give it him; and this is the very reaſon why there are ſo many mercyes denied to you, becauſe of your diſcontentment, you are diſcontented for want of them, and therefore you have them not, you doe deprive your ſelves of the injoyment of your own deſires becauſe of the diſcontentment of your hearts, becauſe you have not your deſires, and is not this a fooliſh thing?</p>
               <p>3 There's a great deal of folly in this, <hi>there are many fooliſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages commonly that a diſcontented heart is guilty of. They carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fooliſhly towards God and towards men,</hi> there are ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and ſuch kind of behaviour comes from them, as makes their friends to be aſhamed of them many times, their carriages are ſo unſeemly, they are a ſhame to themſelves &amp; their friends.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>There is a great deal of folly in diſcontent and murmuring, for it doth eate out the good and ſweetneſſe of a mercie before it comes,</hi> if God ſhould give a mercie that we are diſcontented for the want of, yet the bleſſing of the mercie is as it were eaten out before we come to have it. Diſcontent is like a worm that eates the meat out of the nut, and then when the meat is eaten out of it then you ſhall have the ſhell. If a child ſhould crie for a nut
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:130622:81"/>
that hath the meat eaten out, or all worm-eaten, what good would the child have by having the nut, ſo ſuch an outward comfort you would faine have and you are troubled for the want of it, but the very trouble of your ſpirits is the worm that eates out the bleſſing of the mercy, and then perhaps God gives it you, but gives you it with a curſe mixed with it that you were better not have it then have it. That man or woman that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of ſome good thing, if God doth give that good thing to them before they be humbled for their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that did proceed from them, ſuch a man or woman can have no comfort of the mercy, but it will be rather an evil then a good to them: And therefore for my part if I ſhould have a friend or brother or one that was as dear to me as my own ſoul, that I ſhould ſee diſcontented for the want of ſuch a comfort, I ſhould rather pray, Lord keep this thing from them, tel thou wilt be pleaſed to humble their hearts for their diſcontent, let not them have the mercy till they come to be humbled for their diſcontent for the want of it, for if they have it before that time they will have it without any bleſſing: And therefore it ſhould be your care when you find your hearts diſcontented for want of any thing, to be humbled for it, thinking thus with your ſelves, Lord if that that I do ſo immoderatly deſire ſhould come to me before I be humbled for my diſcontent for want of it, I am certain I can have no comfort of it, but I ſhall rather have it as an affliction to me. Many things which you deſire as your lives, and think that you ſhould be happy if you had them, yet when they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> come you find not ſuch happineſſe in them, but they prove to be the greateſt croſſes and afflictions to you that ever you had, and upon this ground becauſe your hearts were immoderatly ſet upon them before you had them. As it was with <hi>Rachel</hi> ſhe muſt have children or elſe ſhe dyed, well ſaith God ſeeing you <hi>muſt,</hi> you ſhal have them, but though ſhe had a child ſhe dyed according to what ſhe ſaid <hi>Give me children or elſe I die.</hi> So in regard of any other outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, people may have the thing, but often times they have it ſo as it proves the heavieſt cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:130622:81"/>
want of it, it may be it was ſick, and your hearts were out of temper for fear that you ſhould looſe it, and God reſtores it, but he reſtores it ſo as he makes it a croſſe to your heart all the daies of your lives. One obſerves concerning <hi>Manna,</hi> when the people were contented with their allowance that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, then it was verie good, but when they would not be content with Gods allowance, but would gather more then God would have them, then ſaith the text there was worms in it: So when we are content with our conditions, and that that God diſpoſes of us to be in, there's a bleſſing in it, then it is ſweet to us, but if we muſt needs have more, and keep it longer then God would have us to have it, then there will be wormes in it and no good at all.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Ther's a great deal of folly in diſcontentedneſs, for it makes our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction a great deal worſe then otherwiſe it would be;</hi> It no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves our affliction, nay while they do continue they are a great deal the worſe &amp; heavier, for a diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented heart is a proud heart, and a proud heart will not pull downe his ſails when there comes a tempeſt and ſtorme: If a marriner when a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and ſtorme comes ſhould be froward and would not pull down his ſails, but is diſcontented with the ſtorm, is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the better becauſe he is diſcontented and will not pull down his ſails? Will this help him? Juſt ſo is it for all the world with a diſcontented heart, a diſcontented heart is a proud heart, and he out of his pride is troubled with his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is not contented with Gods diſpoſe, and ſo hee will not pull down his ſpirit at all, and make it to bow to God in this condition in which God hath brought him, now is his condition the better becauſe he will not pull down his ſpirit? no certainly abundantly worſe, a thouſand to one but the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and ſtorm overwhelms his ſoul; and thus you ſee what a great deale of folly there is in the ſinne of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ninth evill of murmuring and diſcontentment is this, <hi>There's a mighty deal of danger in the ſin of diſcontentment, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provoketh the wrath of God,</hi> it is a ſin that doth much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God againſt his creature, we find moſt ſad expreſſions in Scripture (and examples too) how God hath bin provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

It is uſuall for wicked vile hearts to deal thus with God, that when Gods hand is a little upon them for to murmur again and again, and ſo to bring upon themſelves even infinite kind of evills; but now the anger of God was quickly kindled, Oh ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> go take the Cenſer quickly for wrath is gone out from Jehovah, the plague is begun, ſo while you are murmuring in your families, the wrath of God may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe out againſt you, quickly, in a morning or evening, when you are murmuring, the wrath of God may come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out upon your families or perſons, you are never ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for preſent wrath as when you are in a murmuring diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented fit, thoſe that ſtand by and ſee you in a murmuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented fit, have cauſe to ſay Oh let us go and take the cenſer, let us go to prayer for we are afraid that wrath is gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this family, againſt this perſon: And it were a verie good thing for thee that art a godly wife when you ſee your husband come home and fall to murmuring becauſe things goe not according to his deſire, to go to prayer, and ſay Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſin of my husband; and ſo for the husband to go to God in prayer falling down and beſeeching of him that wrath may not come out againſt his family for the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wife. And the truth is, at this day there hath been (at leaſt lately) as much murmuring in England as ever was,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:130622:83"/>
and even in this very particular the plague is begun, and this very judgment it doth come many times upon murmuring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are ſo diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented in their families, &amp; are alwaies a grumbling and murmuring at any thing that falls out amiſle. I ſay this text of Scripture in <hi>Numb.</hi> doth clearly hold forth this, that the Lord brings the plague upon men for this ſin of murmuring, he doth it in kingdomes and families, and upon particular perſons. Though we cannot alwaies point out the particular ſin that God brings this for, yet this ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined how far we are guilty of the ſin of murmuring, becauſe the Scripture holds forth this ſo clearly that <hi>Moſes</hi> when he did but hear that they murmured, doe they murmur, ſaith hee goe forth quickly and ſeeke to pacifie the anger of God, for wrath is gone out, and the plague is begun. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. There you have a notable example of Gods heavie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt murmuring, <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the destroyer.</hi> Take heed of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring as ſome of them did, (he ſpeaks of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe,) but ſaith he what came of it? <hi>They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the deſtroyer:</hi> Now the deſtroyer is thought to be the firey ſerpents that were ſent among them: They murmured and God ſent firey ſerpents to ſting them. What do you think that ſuch a croſſe and affliction doth ſting you? perhaps ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is upon you, and it ſeems to be grievious for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what doe you murmure and repine? God hath greater croſſes to bring upon you: Thoſe people that murmur for the want of outward comforts, for want of water, (ſometimes) and for the want of bread, they murmur, but the Lord ſends firey ſerpents among them. I may ſay to a murmuring heart, <hi>Woe to thee that ſtriveſt with thy maker,</hi> woe to that man, that woman, that ſtrives againſt their maker, what doeſt thou elſe but ſtrive againſt thy maker? Thy maker hath the abſolute diſpoſe of thee, and wilt thou ſtrive againſt thy maker? what doth this murmuring diſcontented heart of thine do otherwiſe but wrangle and contend and ſtrive even with God himſelf? Oh woe to him that ſtrives againſt his maker! I may further ſay to thee, as God ſpeaks to <hi>Job. Job,</hi> 38. 1, 2. when <hi>Job</hi> was impatient, <hi>Now God ſpake</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>out of the whirlwind,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:130622:84"/>
and ſaid, who is this that darkeneth counſell by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> So doeſt thou ſpeak againſt Gods waies, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that hath fallen out concerning thy eſtate and outward comforts? who is this? <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Wher's that man or woman whoſe hearts are ſo bold and impudent, as dares ſpeak againſt the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods providence?</p>
               <p>The tenth evill of murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>There's a great curſe of God upon it, ſo far as it doth prevail in one that is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it hath the curſe of God upon it.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 15, See there what the curſe of God is upon wicked and ungodly men, <hi>Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not ſatisfied,</hi> that is the imprecation and curſe upon wicked and ungodly men, that if they be not ſatisfied they ſhall grudge; when thou art not ſatisfied in thy deſires and findeſt thy heart grudging againſt God, apply this Scripture, what is the curſe of the wicked upon me? This is the curſe that is threatened upon wicked and ungodly ones, that they ſhall grudge if they be not ſatisfied? And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 67. There it's threatened as a curſe of God upon men, that they cannot be content with their preſent condition, <hi>But they ſhall ſay in the morning, would God it were even; and at even, would God it were morning;</hi> and ſo they lie toſſing up and down and cannot be content with any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are in, becauſe of the ſore afflictions that be upon them, and therefore it is further threatened as a curſe upon them, in the 34. <hi>verſe, That they ſhould be mad for the fight of their eyes which they ſhould ſee,</hi> this is but the extremity of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſſe, that is, they ſhall be ſo diſcontented, as they ſhall be even mad: Many men and women in diſcontented moods are mad kind of people, and though you may pleaſe your ſelves in ſuch a mad kind of behaviour, yet know that it is a curſe of God upon men to be given up to a kind of madneſs for evils that they ſuppoſe are upon them, &amp; that they fear. In the 47 <hi>verſe,</hi> there is a notable expreſſion for to ſhew the curſe of God upon murmuring hearts; The Lord threatning the curſes that ſhall be upon them, (ſaith he) <hi>verſe,</hi> 45, &amp; 46. &amp; 47. <hi>The curſe ſhall purſue thee, and they ſhall be upon thee for a ſign, and for a wonder, and upon thy ſeed forever: Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:130622:84"/>
Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things.</hi> God here threatens to bring his curſe ſo upon them, as to make them a wonder and a ſign to others, why? <hi>Becauſe they ſerved not the Lord with joyfulneſs of heart,</hi> (that may be aded to that of the wrath of God upon men) therefore God would bring ſuch a curſe upon them as would make them a wonder to all that were about them; Oh how far art thou then that haſt a murmuring heart, from ſerving the Lord with joyfulneſſe?</p>
               <p>The Eleventh evill of diſcontent and murmuring is this. <hi>There is much of the ſpirit of Satan in a murmuring ſpirit.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is the moſt diſcontented creature that is in the world: He is the proudeſt creature that is, and the diſcontentedſt creature; and the moſt dejected creature. Now therefore ſo much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as thou haſt, ſo much of the ſpirit of Satan thou haſt. It was the unclean ſpirit that went up and down and found no reſt; ſo when a man or womans ſpirit hath no reſt, it is a ſign that it hath much of the unclean ſpirit, of the ſpirit of Satan, and thou ſhouldeſt think this with thy ſelfe, Oh Lord what have I the ſpirit of Satan upon me? It is Satan that is the moſt diſcontented ſpirit that is, and Oh! how much of his ſpirit have I upon me that can find no reſt at all?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, murmuring and diſcontent hath this evill in it, <hi>There is an abſolute neceſſity that thou ſhouldeſt have diſquiet all the daies of thy life.</hi> As if a man that is in a great croud ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that other folks touch him; While we are in this world God hath ſo ordred things that afflictions muſt befall us, and if we will complain and be diſcontented upon every croſſe and affliction, why we muſt complain and be diſcontent all the daies of our lives, yea God in juſt judgment will let things fall out on purpoſe to vex thoſe that have vexing ſpirits, and diſcontented hearts, and therefore there is a neceſſitie that they ſhould live diſquiet all their daies: And men will not much care to diſquiet thoſe that are continually murmuring, Oh they will have diſquiet all their daies.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there's this dreadfull evil in diſcontent and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>God may juſtly withdraw his care of yon, and his protection over you, ſeeing God cannot pleaſe you in his adminiſtrations, we</hi>

uſe to ſay ſo to diſcontented ſervants; nay, if you be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mend your ſelves when you will. If you have a ſervant not content with his diet and wages, and work, you ſay mend your ſelves, ſo may God juſtly ſay to us, we that profeſſe our ſelves ſervants to him, to be in his work, and yet are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this thing or that in Gods family, God might juſtly ſay mend your ſelves. What if God ſhould ſay to any of you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now all things that doe befall you, befall you through a providence of God, and if you be thoſe that belong to God there is a protection of God over you, and a care of God. Now if God ſhould ſay, well you ſhall not have the benefit of my protection any longer, and I will take no farther care of you, would not this be a moſt dreadfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I only mentioned this the laſt day, that I might ſhew to you what a great ſin it is at ſuch a time as this. The Lord this ſommer hath multiplyed mercies one upon another, the Lord hath made this ſummer to be a continued miracle of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, never did a Kingdom injoy (in ſo little ſpace of time) ſuch mercies one upon another: Now the publicke mercies of God ſhould quiet our hearts and keep us from diſcontent, and the ſin of diſcontent for private afflictions is exceedingly aggravated by the conſideration of publique mercies to the Land; when the Lord hath bin ſo merciful to the Land wilt thou be fretting and murmuring, becauſe thou haſt not in thy family all the Comforts that thou wouldeſt have? As it is a great agravation of a mans evill for him to rejoyce immoderately in his owne privat comforts when the Church is in affliction, when the publick ſuffers grievous and hard troubles, if any man ſhall then rejoyce and give liberty to himſelf, at that time to ſatisfie his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſh to the uttermoſt in all outward comforts, this is a great Agravation of his ſin: So on the contrary for any man to be immoderately troubled for any private afflictions when it goes well with the publick, with the Churches, this is a great Agravation of his ſin: It may be when the Church of God was loweſt, &amp; it went worſt in other parts, yet thou didſt abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the comforts of thy fleſh, but gaveſt full liberty to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy fleſh as formerly, know this was thy great ſin, ſo on the other ſide when we have received ſuch mercies in publick, we ſhould have all our private afflictions ſwallowed up in the publick mercies: And we ſhould think with our ſelves, though we be afflicted for our particular, yet bleſſed be God it goes well with the Church, and with the publick, the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſhould mightily quiet our hearts in all our privat diſcontents, and if it doth not ſo, know that our ſin is much increaſed by the mercies of God that are abroad. Now ſhall Gods mercies aggravate our ſins? This is a ſad thing, this is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:130622:87"/>
to turne the mercies of God to be our miſery. Didſt not thou pray to God for theſe mercies that God hath ſent of late to the publique, theſe great victories that God hath given dideſt not thou pray for them? now thou haſt them is not there enough in them to quiet thy heart for ſome privat trouble thou meeteſt withall in thy family? Is not there goodneſſe enough there to cure thy diſcontentment? certainly they were not ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſo worthy to be prayed for except they have ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in them as to countervail ſome private afflictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publick mercies are the aggravation of privat diſcontent, As ſo of publick diſcontent too if we receive ſo many publick mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, yet if every thing goes not in the publick according as we deſire, if we be diſcontent at that it will exceedingly aggravate our ſin, God may ſay, what ſhall I beſtow ſuch mercies upon a people, and yet if they have not every thing they would have they will be diſcontent? Oh it is exceeding evill. So in particular, the mercies that concernes thy ſelfe, thy family, if thou wouldeſt conſider thou haſt a great many more mercies then thou hadeſt afflictions, I dare boldly aver it concerning any one in this congregation, (ſuppoſe thy afflictions to be what they will) there is never a one of you but that have more mecies then afflictions.</p>

If it were but this mercie, that you have this day of grace and ſalvation continued to you, it's a greater mercy then any affliction, ſet any affliction by this mercy and ſee which would weigh heavieſt, this is certainly greater then any affliction; that you have the day of grace and ſalvation, that you are not now in hell, this is a greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: That you have the ſound of the Goſpel yet in your ears; that you have the uſe of your reaſon, this is a greater mercy then your afflictions, that you have the uſe of your limbs, yout ſences, that you have the health of your bodies, health

of body is a greater mercy then poverty is an affliction, there is no man that is rich but if he be wiſe, if he hath a ſickly body, he would part with al his riches that he might have his health, therefore thy mercies are more then thy afflictions We find in Scripture how the Holy Ghoſt doth agravate the ſin of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content from the conſideration of mercies, you have a notable Scripture for it in the 16. of <hi>Numb. 8. verſe &amp;c.</hi> It's a ſpeech of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You ſee 'tis a great honour that God puts upon a man, a great mercy that he doth beſtow upon any man to ſeparate him from others for himſelfe, to come neer to him, to imploy him in the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to miniſter to the Congregation in holy things, this is a great mercy, and indeed it's ſuch a mercy as one would think there ſhould be none that God beſtows ſuch a mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhould have a murmuring heart for any affliction; It's true, many Miniſters of God they meet with hard things that might diſcourage them, and trouble and grieve their ſpirits, but now this conſideration that God is pleaſed to imploy them in ſuch a ſervice neer to himſelfe, that though they cannot doe good to themſelves, yet they may do good to others, this ſhould quiet them. And yet in the 10. <hi>verſe, And he hath brought thee neer to him, and all thy Brethren the Sons of</hi> Levi <hi>with thee, and ſeeke yee the Prieſt-hood alſo?</hi> have not you enough already? but ſtill you are diſcontented with what you have and muſt have more, ſeek ye yet more? <hi>Seek ye the Prieſt-hood alſo? for which cauſe both thou and all thy Company are gathered together againſt the Lord: And what is</hi> Aaron <hi>that yee murmure againſt him?</hi> what hath God given you ſuch things, and yet will you be murmuring, becauſe you

cannot have more? me thinks that this place ſhould keep Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from murmuring, though they ſhould meet with never ſuch afflictions and croſſes, and unkind dealings from men, yet ſtill they ſhould go on with hearts quieted and comforted in the work that God hath ſet them about, and labour to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile all their Afflictions by being more abundant in the work of the Lord, that is the firſt text of Scripture that ſhewes how the mercies we enjoy are Agravations to the ſin of murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>And then a ſecond Scripture is in the 2. of <hi>Job 10. ver.</hi> A ſpeech of <hi>Job</hi> to his wife, what ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> when his wife would have had him curſſe God and die? (that was a degree beyond murmuring) why ſaith he <hi>thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women, ſhall we receive good at the hand of God and not evill?</hi> you ſee <hi>Iob</hi> did help himſelfe againſt all murmuring thoughts againſt the ways of God with this conſideration, that he had received ſo much good from the Lord, what though we receive evill, yet doe not we receive good as well as evill? let us ſet one againſt the other, that's the way we ſhould go. In the 7. of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the 14. <hi>verſ,</hi> you have a notable Scripture there whereby you may ſee what courſe is to be taken when the heart riſes in murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, In the day of proſperity be joyfull, <hi>but in the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity conſider,</hi> what ſhould they conſider?

That God hath ſet one over againſt the other, thou haſt a great deal of Affliction, and thou haſt had a great deal of proſperity, thou haſt many troubles, and thou haſt had many mercies, make one column of mercies, and one colume of afflictions, and write one againſt the other, and ſee if God hath not fill'd one colume as full as the other, you look altogether upon your afflictions, but look upon your mercies alſo; for inſtance: It may be God hath afflicted you in one child, but he hath been mercifull to you in another child, ſet one againſt the other, God afflicted <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but he was mercifull to <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:130622:89"/>
in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and therefore when <hi>David</hi> cryed out, oh <hi>Abſolom my Son my Son?</hi> if <hi>David</hi> had thought upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> and cryed oh <hi>Solomon</hi> my ſon my ſon, it would have quieted him. And it may be God hath been mercifull to thee in a wife, or in thy husband, ſet that againſt thy affliction, it may be God croſſes thee in thy eſtate, but it may be he doth imploy thee in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it may be thou art afflicted in ſome of thy friends, but thou haſt other friends that are great mercies to thee, and therefore you ſhould ſet one againſt the other, and it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne you ſo to doe, for thoſe mercies will be agravations of your ſins, and you had better make Gods mercies a means to leſſen your ſins, then to be the agravation of your ſins: If you make not the mercies of God to helpe you againſt your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, you will make them to be agravations of the ſinne of murmuring. I beſeech you for this take but this one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration further, and if you will but work it upon your hearts I hope you may find a great deal of power in it, you find affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and your hearts are troubled and murmur, conſider how Gods mercies doth agravate this ſin, thus. In the midſt of our ſins we doe make account God ſhould accept of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, doe but conſider thus, if in the midſt of our many ſinnes wee hope that God will accept of our poor ſervices, why then ſhould not we in the midſt of our afflictions bleſſe God for his many mercies? ſhall God be thus gracious to us that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our many ſins, yet he will not caſt away our poor duties and ſervices that we perform, then why ſhould not we in the midſt of our ſufferings accept of what mercies we have, and not ſlight them and diſregard them? If thou in the midſt of Gods mercies ſhalt not be willing to bear afflictions that God layes upon thee, then it were juſt with God that in the midſt of thy ſins he ſhould not regard any of thy duties, now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> there not as much power in thy manifould ſins to cauſe God to reject thy duties and ſeivices, as there is power in afflictions (in the mid'ſt of many mercies) to take off thy heart from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with Gods mercies? And that's the fiſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of of the ſinne of murmuring to murmur in the mid'ſt of mercies.</p>
               <p>A ſecond aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>When we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:130622:89"/>
murmur for ſmall things,</hi> Saith <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervant to him, Father (for ſo he called him) if the Prophet had required you to doe ſome great thing, would not you have done it? how much more this little thing. So I ſay if the Lord had required you to ſuffer ſome great matter would not you have bin willing to ſuffer? How much more this little thing. I remember I have read in <hi>Seneca</hi> a Heathen, he hath this ſimilitude which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine one to ſet out the great evil of murmuring upon ſmaller afflictions, (ſaith he) ſuppoſe a man hath a very fair houſe to dwell in, and he hath fair orchards and gardens, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with brave tall trees for ornament, if this man now ſhould murmur becauſe the wind blows off a few leavs off his trees, what a moſt unreaſonable thing were it for him to be weeping and wringing his hands becauſe he looſes a few leavs off his trees, when he hath abundance of all kinde of fruit? thus it is with many ſaith he, though they have a great many comforts about them, yet ſome little matter, the blowing off of a few leavs from them is enough to diſquiet them. It was a great evill when <hi>Ahab</hi> having a kingdom, yet the want of his neighbours vineyard had ſuch power to diſquiet him: So for us to murmur, not becauſe we have not ſuch a thing as we have need of, but becauſe we have not what poſſibly we might have, this is a very great ſin. Suppoſe God gives a child that hath all the limbs and parts compleat, a child that is very comly, and hath excellent parts, wit, and memory, but it may be there is a wart that grows upon the finger of the child, and ſhe murmurs at it, and Oh what an affliction this is to her! ſhe is ſo taken up with that as ſhe forgets to give any thankes to God for her child, and all the goodneſſe of God to her in the child is ſwallowed up in that; would not you ſay this were a folly &amp; a very great evill in a woman ſo to do? Truly our afflictions if we weighed them aright they are but ſuch kind of things in compariſon of our mercies. <hi>Rebeckah</hi> ſhe had a mighty deſire to have children, but becauſe ſhe found ſome trouble in her body when ſhe was with child, ſaith ſhe <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay I had as good have none, onely becauſe ſhe found a little paine and trouble in her body. To be diſcontent when the affliction is ſmall and little, that increaſes very much the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:130622:90"/>
ſin of murmuring, it is to much for any one to murmur upon the heavieſt croſſe that can befall one in this world, but upon ſome ſmall things to be diſcontent and murmur, that's worſe. I have read of one when he lay upon a heap of damask-roſes, he complained that there was one of the roſe leaves lay double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: So we are ready thus for very ſmall things to make complaints and to be diſcontented with our condition, and that's a ſecond aggravation.</p>
               <p>A third aggravation is this, <hi>For men that are of parts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that God hath given wiſdom to, for them to be diſcontent and murmur, that is more then if others do it.</hi> Murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe it too much in the weakeſt, yet we can bear with it ſometimes in children and women that are weake, but for thoſe that are men, men of underſtanding, that have wiſdom, that God imployes in publick ſervice, that they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with every thing, this is an exceeding great evill; for men in their families (to whom God hath given parts and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) when things fall out amiſſe there, to be alwaies murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining, their ſin is greater then for women or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to do it.</p>
               <p>A fourth agravation <hi>Is the conſideration of the freeneſs of all Gods mercies to us.</hi> What ever we have it is of free coſt, what though we have not all we would have, ſeeing what we have is free? If what we have were earned then it were ſomewhat, but when we conſider that all is from God, for us to murmur at his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations is very evill. Suppoſe a man were in a family entertaind by a friend, and he did not pay for his board but he hath it given him for nothing, it's expected ſuch a one ſhould not be ready to find fault with every thing in the houſe, with ſervants or with meat at table or the like, if ſuch a one that hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull proviſion and all given him <hi>Gratis,</hi> and payes nothing for his board, ſhould be diſcontented if a cup ſhould not be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for him as he would have it, or if he ſhould ſtay a minute of an houre longer for a thing then he would, this we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a great evill: So it is with us, we are at Gods table every day, and it is upon free-coſt whatever we have: It is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very unmannerly for a man at his friends table to find fault with things though at home he may be bold: Now when we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:130622:90"/>
are at the table of God (for ſo all Gods adminiſtrations to us are his table) and are at free-coſt, now for us to be finding fault and be diſcontented this is a great aggravation of our ſinne.</p>
               <p>A fift aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>When men and women murmur and are diſcontented and impatient when they have the things that they were diſcontented for the want of before they had them.</hi> So it is ſometimes with children, they will cry for ſuch a thing, and when you give it them then throw it away, they are as much diſcontented as they were before. So it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nothing would quiet them but they muſt have a King, <hi>Samuel</hi> perſwaded them to the contrary, and told them what kind of King they ſhould have; and when they had a King, in <hi>Hoſ. 10. 3. What ſhall a King do to us?</hi> they were not contented when they had one. So <hi>Rachel</hi> ſhee muſt have children or elſe ſhee died, and when ſhee had a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhee was diſcontented too,; ſo that we are neither well full nor faſting (as we uſe to ſay)</p>
               <p>The ſixth aggravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For thoſe men and women to be diſcontent and murmur that God hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from mean and low eſtates and conditions,</hi> This is a very great aggravation if thou be diſcontent now: There was a time when thou wert low enough, and perhaps when thou wert ſo low then thou dideſt ſay, oh if God would deliver me from ſuch an affliction, or give me but a little more in my eſtate I ſhould think my ſelfe in a good condition: but if God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth raiſe thee, thou art as greedy of more ſtill as thou wert before, and as much diſcontented as thou wert before: this is an evill thing for people that had mean breeding, and poor beginings for them to be ſo nice, and dainty that nothing can pleaſe them, whereas there was a time not long ſince that they were low and mean enough; but it is very ordinary for thoſe that are raiſed from a low and mean condition to be the more nice and dainty, and more proud when they are raiſed then others that are of better breeding: It's to much for a child to be diſcontented in his fathers houſe, but if a man hath taken a poor begger boy, if you had taken ſuch a one into your houſe that lay begging at your door, and ſet him at your own table,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:130622:91"/>
could you bear that ſuch a one ſhould complain that ſuch a thing is not well dreſt, or the like, you could not bear it if your children ſhould do it, but you could bear it a grert deal better with them then to hear ſuch a one do it: But thou art a poor begger and God hath (as it were) taken thee into his great family, and if the Lord hath been pleaſed to raiſe thee higher, that now thou haſt a competency, that thou mayeſt live as a man, to be of uſe and ſervice in the place where God hath ſet thee, now wilt thou be diſcontent becauſe thou haſt not every thing that thou deſireſt? We know the prodigall when he came to himſelfe Oh! ſaith he) <hi>In my fathers houſe is bread enough,</hi> he did not ſay there's good-cheere enough and a great deale of dainties, no, he thought of nothing but bread, <hi>there's bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> ſo it's ordinary for men and women when they are in a low condition, they think that if they may have bread, any competency, they will be contented and bleſſe God, but when they have their bread and things convenient, they muſt have more or elſe they are not contented, know that this is an exceeding great aggravation to thy diſcontentment, when you are raiſed from a very low condition and yet you cannot be contented with what you have.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh aggravation of this ſin is this, <hi>For them to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that have hin very great ſinners and ungodly in their former time.</hi> For men and women that have much guiltineſſe upon them, the guilt of very many ſins upon them, that have provokt God exceedingly againſt them, and have brought themſelves in a moſt dreadfull manner under the ſentence of Gods juſtice, and yet God being pleaſed to reprieve them, for them to murmure and to be diſcontent with Gods adminiſtrations towards them this is exceeding evill, Oh it were conſideration enough to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et any murmuring in our hearts, to think thus, we are but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners why ſhould not we be ſufferers that are ſinners? but then conſider we that are ſuch great ſinners, guilty of ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins, that it is a wonder that we are out of Hell at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet for us to be diſcontent and murmur how exceedingly doth this increaſe our ſin! Conſider how we have croſſed God in our ſinns, then if God ſhould croſſe us in the way of our ſufferings ſhould not we ſit down quiet without murmuring?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:130622:91"/>
Certainly thou never kneweſt what it was to be humbled for thy manifold ſins, that art diſcontented at any adminiſtration of God towards thee.</p>
               <p>The eighth agravation of the ſin of murmuring is, <hi>For thoſe men that are of little uſe in the world for them to be diſcontented.</hi> If you have but a beaſt that you make much uſe of you wil feed it well, but if you have but little uſe of him then you turne him into the commons, little proviſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on ſerves his turn becauſe you make not uſe of him: If we lived ſo as to be exceeding uſefull to God and his Church, we might expect that God would be pleaſed to come in, in ſome encouraging way to us, but when out conſciences tel us we live and do but little ſervice for God, why what if God ſhould turn us upon the commons, yet we are fed according to our work? according to our imployment? why ſhould any creature be ſervicable to thee who art ſo little ſervicable to God? This one meditation would much help us, to think, I am diſcontent becauſe ſuch and ſuch creatures are not ſerviceable to me, but why ſhould I expect that they ſhould be ſerviceable to me when I am not ſerviceable to God? and that is the eighth agravation.</p>
               <p>A ninth agravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>For us to be diſcontent at that time when God is about to humble us.</hi> It ſhould be the care of a Chriſtian to obſerve what are Gods waies to wards him, what is God about to do with me at this time? Is God about to raiſe me, to comfort me? let me cloſe with Gods goodneſs, and bleſſe his name; let me joyn with the work of God, when he offers mercy to me, to take the mercy he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. But again, is God about to humble me? is God about to break my heart, and to bring my heart down to him? let me joyne with God in this work of his, this is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to walke with God. It is ſaide that <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, walked with God what's that? That is, To obſerve what is the worke of God that God is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and to joyn with God in that work of his; ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God turns this way or that way, the heart ſhould turn with God, and have ſutable workings unto the workings of God towards him. Now then I am diſcontented and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, becauſe I am afflicted; Therefore thou art afflicted

becauſe God would humble thee, and the great deſigne that God hath in afflicting of thee, is to break and humble thy heart; and wilt thou now maintain a ſpirit quite oppoſite to the work of God? for thee to murmur &amp; be diſcontented is to reſiſt the work of God, God is doing thee good if thou couldſt ſee it, now if he be pleaſed to ſanctifie thy affliction, to breake that hard heart of thine, and humble that proud ſpirit of thine, it would be the greateſt mercie that ever thou had'ſt in all thy life, now wilt thou yet ſtand out againſt God? It's even as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, well, the Lord is about to break me, and humble me, but he ſhall not: this is the language of thy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and thy diſcontentedneſs, though thou dareſt not ſay ſo, but though thou ſayeſt not ſo in words, yet it is certainly the language of the temper of thy ſpirit, Oh conſider what an agravation this is: I am diſcontented when God is about to work ſuch a work upon me as is exceedingly for my good, but yet I ſtand out againſt him and reſiſt him, and that's another agravation.</p>
               <p>A tenth aggravation of the ſin of murmuring and diſcontent is this, <hi>The more palpable nnd remarkable the band of God appears to bring about an affliction, the greater is the ſin of murmuring and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content under an affliction.</hi> It's a great evil any time to murmur and be diſcontent, but though it be a ſin, when I ſee but an ordinary providence working for me not to ſubmit to that, but when I ſee an extraordinary providence working thats a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin, that is, when I ſee the Lord in ſome remarkable way working about ſuch an affliction beyond what any could have thought of, ſhall I reſiſt ſuch a remarkable hand of God, ſhall I ſtand out againſt God when I ſee God doth expreſs his will in ſuch a remarkable manner, that he would have me to be in ſuch a condition? Indeed before we ſee the wil of God apparent we may deſire to avoid an affliction, and may uſe means for it, but now when we ſee God expreſſing his will from heaven in a manner beyond ordinary, and more remarkably, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is fit for us to fall down and ſubmit to him, and not to oppoſe when God comes with a mighty ſtream againſt us, it is our beſt way to fall down before him and not to reſiſt, for as it is an argument of a mans diſobedieuce, when there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:130622:93"/>
a command againſt a ſin but when God reveals his command in a terrible way, the more ſolemne the Command of God is, the greater is the ſin in breaking that command, ſo the more remarkable the hand of God is in bringing an Affliction upon us, the greater is the ſin for us to murmur and be diſcontented. Then God expects that we ſhould fall down when he (as it were) ſpeaks from heaven to thee by name and ſaith, well, I wil have this ſpirit of thine down, do not you ſee that my hand is ſtretched out, my eyes are upon you, my thoughts are upon you, and I muſt have that proud ſpirit of thine down? Oh then it is fit for the Creature to yeild and ſubmit unto him. When you ſpeak in an ordinary manner to your ſervants, or children, you expect they ſhould regard what you ſay, but when you make them ſtand ſtill by you and you ſpeak to them in a more ſolemn way, then if they ſhould diſ-regard what you ſay, you are very impatient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So certainly God cannot take it well, when ever he doth appear from heaven in ſuch a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaple way to bring an Affliction, if then we do not ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p>The eleventh agravation of the ſin of murmuring is this, <hi>To be diſcontented though God hath bin exerciſing of us long under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet fill to remain diſcontented.</hi> For a man or woman at firſt when an affliction befals them to have a murmuring heart, then it's an evill, but to have a murmuring heart when God hath been a long time exerciſing them with affliction it's more evill. Though an heifer at firſt when the yoke is put upon him he wrigles up and down and will not be quiet, but if after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moneths or yeers it ſhall not draw quietly, the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would rather feede it fat and prepare it for the butcher then be troubled any longer with it: So though the Lord was content to paſſe by that diſcontented ſpirit of thine at firſt, yet God having a long time kept the yoke upon thee, thou haſt bin under his afflicting hand (it may be) divers years; and yet thou remain diſcontent ſtill, it were juſt with God that he ſhould bear thy murmuring no longer, and that thy diſcontent under the affliction ſhould be but a preparation to thy deſtruction. So you ſee when a man or woman hath been long exerciſed with afflictions and yet are diſcontented, that's an agravation of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:130622:94"/>
ſin: Mark that text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent is joyous, but greivous, nevertheleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it yeildeth the peaceable fruit of Righteousneſs unto them which are exerciſed therby.</hi> It's true, our afflictions are not joyous but greivious, though at firſt when our affliction comes it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greivous, But yet (ſaith the text) afterwards it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of Righteouſneſſe to thoſe that are exerciſed thereby: When thou haſt been a long time in the School of afflictions, thou art a very dullard in Chriſts School if thou haſt not learned this Contentment. I have <hi>learned</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) in every eſtate therewith to be content. Paul</hi> had learned this Leſſon quickly? thou haſt been a learning many yeers; perhaps thou mayeſt ſay as <hi>Heman</hi> did, <hi>That thou art afflicted from thy youth up,</hi> in the 88. <hi>Pſal.</hi> Oh it's a very evil thing if being exerciſed long with afflictions you are not yet contented. The eye in the body of a man is as tender a part as any part that a mans body hath, but yet the eye is able to continue in and bear a great deal of cold, becauſe it is more uſed to it: ſo thoſe that are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to afflictions, thoſe that God exerciſes much with Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, (though they have tender ſpirits otherwiſe) yet they ſhould have learned Contentedneſs by this time. A new Cart may creek and make an noiſe, but after the uſe of it a while it will not do ſo: So when thou art firſt a Chriſtian and newly come into the work of Chriſt, perhaps thou makeſt a noiſe and canſt not bear affliction: but art thou an old Chriſtian and yet wilt thou be a murmuring Chriſtian? Oh that's a ſhame for any that are Ancient Profeſſors, that have been a long time in the School of Jeſus Chriſt to have murmuring and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirits. And thus you have had a leaven agravations of this ſin of murmuring and diſcontent.</p>
               <p>But now my Brethren becauſe this diſcontented humour is a very tough humonr, and it is very hard to work upon, there's none that are diſcontented but will have ſomething to ſay for their diſcontent, I ſhal therefore deſire to take away what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcontented heart hath to ſay for himſelf.</p>

And thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would hide their ſinful murmuring under Gods hand with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it is but ſenſibleneſs of their affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, firſt there is no ſence of any affliction that will hinder the ſence of Gods mercies, nay the more we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our afflictions if it be in a gracious manner, the more ſenſible we will be of Gods mercie, but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy affliction as it takes away the ſenſe of all thy mercies, Oh this is ſinfull diſcontent, this is not to be ſenſible of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as God would have thee, but it is to be ſenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it doth then it goes beyond the bounds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it were but a bare ſence of an affliction it would not hinder thee in the duties of thy condition, the right ſence of our afflictions will never hinder us in the performence of the duties of our condition, but thou art ſo ſenſible of thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as thou art made unfit for the performence of the duties of the condition that God hath put th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>But will a diſcontented heart ſay, I am not ſo much troubled with my afflictions, but it is for my ſin rather then my afflictions: and I hope you wil give leave that we ſhould be troubled and diſcontented with our ſin, and were it not for ſin that I ſee in my ſelf I ſhould not be ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as I am, Oh! it is ſin that is heavy upon me, and it's that that troubles me more then my affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deceive not thine own heart, there is a very great deceit in this, there's many people that when Gods hand is out againſt them they will ſay they are troubled for their ſin, but the truth is, it's the affliction that doth trouble them rather then their ſin, their hearts doth exceedingly deceive them in this very thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt they were never troubled for their ſin before this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came, but you wil ſay, it' true I was not before, for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity blinded me, but now God hath opened mine eyes by Afflictions; Hath he ſo?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, then thy great care will be rather for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thy ſin then thy affliction, art thou more ſolicitous about the taking away thy ſin, then the taking away of thine affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if it be thy ſin that troubles thee, if God ſhould take away thy affliction, yet except thy ſin be taken away, and thy heart be better, this would not content thee, thou couldeſt not be ſatisfied, but we ſee it ordinarily, that if God removes their affliction there's no nore trouble for their ſin: Oh many doe belie themſelves in this, in ſaying that they are ſo troubled for their ſin, and eſpecially thoſe that are ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they are in danger to miſcarry, and to make away themſelves, there's not one in ten thouſand that are in ſuch a condition as this is, but it is affliction rather theu ſinne that puts them to it: indeed you lay all upon this, as if it were the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:130622:95"/>
work of the word, or the ſpirit of bondage: I remember I heard not long ſince of a Divine that being iudicious, and uſed to ſuch kind of things, there came a man to him migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily troubled for his ſinne, and he could uot tell what to doe, he was ready to deſpair, the Divine looks upon him, ſaith he are you not in debt? He confeſt that he was; and at length the Miniſter began to find it out, that that was his trouble rather then his ſin, and ſo was a means to help him that way, that his creditors ſhould not come upon him, and then the man was pretty quiet, and would not make a way himſelfe any longer; for it is a uſual thing, that if any thing befalls a man that doth croſſe him, Oh then it's their ſin that doth trouble them. Sometimes it is thus with ſervants, if their Governours croſſe them, then they are vext and fret, and come to deale with them, Oh then they wil ſay they are ſorrowful for their ſinne, but we muſt take heed of dallying with God that is the Seer and Searcher of the ſecrets of all hearts, many of you go ſullen and dumpiſh up and down your families, and then you ſay it is your ſin that lies upon you, when God knows it is otherwiſe, it is becauſe you cannot have your wills as you would have.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If thou beeſt troubled for thy ſin, then it will be thy great care not to ſin in thy trouble; not by thy trouble to increaſe thy ſin, but thou art troubled in ſuch a way as the truth is, thou doeſt inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And then laſtly, If it be thy ſin that troubles thee, then thou haſt the more need to ſubmit to Gods hand, <hi>and accept of the pnniſhment of thine iniquity:</hi> as it is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 41.

                  <head>The third Plea.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh ſaith another I find my affliction is ſuch, that God with-draws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Himſelf from me in mine affliction, that is that that troubles me, and can any body be quiet then? can any body he ſatisfied with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:130622:96"/>
when the Lord ſhall with-draw himſelf? were my afflictions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, yet if I found not God with-drawing himſelfe from me I hope I could be content with any affliction, but I cannot find the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with me in this affliction, as ſomtimes I have found, and it is that that troubles me, and makes me to be in ſuch a condition as I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to that I anſwer thus, Firſt it is a very evill thing for men and women upon every affliction to conclude that God is departed from them, it may be when it comes to be examined there is no other reaſon why thou thinkeſt that God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and departed, but becauſe he doth afflict thee, now for thee to make ſuch a concluſion, that every time God laies an affliction upon thee he is departed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a ſinful diſtemper of thy heart, and is very diſhonorable to God, and grievous to his Spirit. In the 17. of <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. verſe, you may ſee how God was diſpleaſed with ſuch a kind of diſtemper as this is. <hi>And he called the name of the place</hi> Maſſah, <hi>and</hi> Meribah, <hi>becauſe of the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Children of Iſrael, and becauſe they tempted the Lord ſaying, is the Lord amongſt us or not?</hi> Mark, they did murmur becauſe they were brought into afflictions, but ſee what the Text ſaith, therefore the place was called <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> becauſe they tempted the Lord ſaying, is the Lord amongſt us or not? This was to tempt God; ſometimes we are afraid God is departed from us, and it was meerly becauſe we are afflicted; I beſeech you obſerve that Scripture, God cals it a tempting of him when he afflicts any, for them to conclude and ſay that God is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them. If a Child ſhould cry out of his Father, and ſay that his Father is turned to be an enemy to him, becauſe he doth correct him; this would be taken ill; I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of this one place, it may be of very great uſe to you, that you may not be ready to think that God is departed, becauſe you are afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God be departed, the greateſt ſign of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting is becauſe you are ſo diſquiet, you make your diſquiet be the fruit of Gods departing, and if it comes to be examined your diſquiet is the cauſe of Gods departing from you, if you could but cure your diſquiet, if you could but quiet your own hearts, and get them into a better frame of contentedneſs under Gods hand in afflicting of you, then you would find Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:130622:96"/>
with you, will you be thus diſquiet til God comes again to you? your diſquiet drives him from you, and you can never expect Gods coming to manifeſt himſelfe comfortably to your ſouls, till you have gotten your hearts quiet under your affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and therefore here you ſee how croſly you reaſon, you reaſon I am diſquiet becauſe God is gone, when the truth is God is gone becauſe thou art diſquiet, reaſon but the other way, Oh my diſquiet hath driven God from me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ever I would have the preſence of God to come again to me, let my heart be quiet under the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, doeſt thou find God departing from thee in thine affliction? wilt thou therefore depart from God too? is this thy help? Can'ſt thou help thy ſelfe that way? Becauſe God is gone wilt thou go too? Doe I indeed feel God departing from me? It may be it is ſo, it may be God for thy tryal is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a little from thee, and is it ſo indeed? what unwiſe courſe doe I take? I commit further ſin and ſo I go further off from God, what a caſe am I in? God goes from me, &amp; I from God: If the child ſees the mother going from it, it's not for the child to ſay my mother is gon yonder &amp; I wil go the other way, no but the child goes crying after the mother; and ſo ſhould the ſoul ſay, I ſee the Lord is withdrawing his preſence from me, and now it is beſt for me to make after the Lord with all my might, and I am ſure this murmuring humour is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after God, but by this I go further and further off from God, and what a diſtance is there like to be between God and me within a little while? Theſe are ſome of the reaſonings and pleas of a murmuring and diſcontented heart, there are many others that we ſhall meet withall, and indeavour to ſpeak to your hearts in them, that ſo this tough humour of diſcontent may (as it were) be cut with the word and ſoftened with the word, that ſo it may paſſe away: for that's the way of Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when they meet with a body that hath any tough humour then they give that that hath a peircing quality, when there is a tough humour that ſtops the water that it cannot paſſe, they give that that hath a peircing quality that may make paſſage for it, and ſo thou haſt need of ſuch things that are piercing to make away through this tough humour that is in the ſpirits of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Me thinks I could be content with Gods hand</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ſo far as I ſee the hand of God in a thing I can be content: but when men deal ſo unreaſonably and unjuſtly with me I know not how to bear that, I can bear it that I ſhould be in Gods hands, but not in the hands of men: My friends or acquaintance when they deal ſo unrighteouſly with mee, Oh this goes very hard unto me, that I know not how to bear it from men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the taking away of this reaſoning, firſt, Though they be men that bring this croſſe upon you, yet they are Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, God hath a hand in it, and they can go no further
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:130622:97"/>
then God would have them goe. This was that that quieted <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shemei</hi> curſt him, (ſaith he) God hath a hand in it, though <hi>Shimei</hi> be a baſe wicked man yet I look beyond him to God. So, is there any of your friends that deal injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, and croſſe with you, look up to God and ſee that man but as an inſtrument in Gods hands,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If this be your trouble that men do ſo wrong you, you are rather to turne your hearts to pitty them then to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or be diſcontented: For the truth is, if you be wronged by other men, you have the better of it, for it is better to bear wrong then to do wrong a great deal, if they wrong you your heart cannot ſubmit; you are in a better condition then they, becauſe it's better to bear then do wrong. I remember it is ſaid of <hi>Socrates</hi> that being very patient when wrong was done to him, they asked him how he came to be ſo, ſaith he if I meet with a man in the ſtreet that is a diſeaſed man, ſhal I be vexed &amp; fretted with him becauſe he is deſeaſed? thoſe that wrong mee I look upon them as deſeaſed men and therefore pitty them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though you meet with hard dealings from men, yet you meet with nothing but kind good and righteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings from God: when you meet with unrighteous dealings from them, ſet one againſt the other.

                  <p>For the anſwer of this, firſt it is thy weakneſſe and folly that thou dideſt not look for it and expect it, In <hi>Acts,</hi> 20. 22, 23. ſee what ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concerning himſelfe, <hi>And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit unto</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befall me there, ſave that the Holy-Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> It's true ſaith he, I know not the particular affliction that may befall me, but this I know that the Spirit of God witneſſeth that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

ſhall abide me every where, I look for nothing elſe but bonds and afflictions whereſoever I go; ſo a Chriſtian ſhould doe, he ſhould look for afflictions whereſoever he is, in all conditions he ſhould look to meet with afflictions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any affliction ſhould befall him, though indeed he could not for-ſee the parcicular evill, yet he ſhould think this is no more then I lookt for in the generall. Therefore no affliction ſhould come unexpectedly to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond anſwer I would give is this, is it unexpected? then the leſſe proviſion thou madeſt for it before it came, the more carefull ſhouldeſt thou be to ſanctifie Gods name in it now it is come, it is in this caſe of afflictions as in mercies, many times mercy comes unexpected: (And that might be a third anſwer) to you, ſet one againſt the other, I have many mercies that I never lookt for as well as afflictions that I never lookt for, why ſhould not one rejoyce me as much as the other diſturbs me? As it is in mercies when they come unexpected, the leſſe preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was in me for receiving mercy, the more need I have to be careful now to give God the glory of the mercy, &amp; to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods name in the injoyment of the mercy, Oh ſo it ſhould be with us now, we have had mercies this ſummer that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expected and therefore we were not prepared for them, now we ſhould be ſo much the more carefull to give God the glory of them: ſo when afflictions come that we did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, then it ſeems we layde not in for them before hand, we had need be the more carefull to ſanctifie Gods name in them, we ſhould have ſpent ſome pains before to prepare for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and we did not, then take ſo much the more pains to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God in this affliction now, and that's a ſift reaſoning.</p>

                  <head>The Sixth Plea</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but it is very great, mine affliction it is exceeding great ſaith one, and how ever you ſay we muſt be be contented, it's true you may ſay ſo that feele not ſuch great afflictions, but if you felt my affliction that I feele you would think it hard to bear and be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, let it be as great an affliction as it will, it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſo great as thy ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He hath puniſhed thee leſſe then thy ſins.</hi>

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:130622:98"/>Secondly, It might have bin a great deal more, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have been in Hell. And it is (as I remember) <hi>Bernards</hi> ſpeech (ſaith he) It is an eaſier matter to be oppreſt then periſh. Thou might'ſt have been in Hell, and therefore the greatneſſe of the thing ſhould not make thee murmur, grant it be great.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may be it's the greater becauſe thy heart doth ſo murmur: for ſhackles upon a mans legs, if his legs be ſore it will pain him the more, if the ſhoulder be ſore the burden is the greater, it is becauſe thy heart is ſo unſound that thy affliction is great unto thee, And that's a ſixth reaſoning.</p>

               <div n="7" type="plea">
                  <head>A Seventh Plea</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But howſoever you may leſſen my affliction, yet I am ſure it is far greater then the affliction of others</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be it is thy diſcontent that makes it greater, when indeed it is not ſo in it's ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it were greater then others, why is thy eye evill becauſe the eye of God is good? Why ſhouldeſt thou be diſcontented the more becauſe God is gracious to others?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is thy affliction greater then others? Then in this thou haſt an opportunity to honour God more then others, ſo thou ſhouldeſt conſider, doth God afflict me more then other men? God gives me an opportunity in this to honour him in this affliction more then other men? To exerciſe more grace then other men, let me labour to do it then.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if all afflictions were layd upon a heap together. It is a notable expreſſion of <hi>Solon</hi> that wiſe Heathen (ſaith he) ſuppoſe all the afflictions that are in the world were layd upon a heap, and every man ſhould come and take a proportion of thoſe afflictions, every one equally, there is ſcarce any man but would rather ſay let me have the afflictions that I had before or elſe he were like to come to a greater ſhare, a greater affliction if ſo be he ſhould equally ſhare with all the world: Now for you that are poor, (that are not in extremity of poverty) if all the riches in the world were layd together and you ſhould have an equal ſhare, you would be poorer, but take all afflictions and ſorrows whatſoever, if all the ſorrows in the world were layd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:130622:99"/>
together in a heap, and you had but an equal ſhare of them, your portion would be rather more then it is now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And therefore doe not complain that it is more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo as to murmur becauſe of that.</p>

                  <head>An Eighth Plea</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another reaſoning that mumurring hearts have is this, why they think that if the affliction were any other then it is, then they would be more contented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, You muſt know that we are not to chooſe our own rod that God ſhall beat us with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be if it were any other then it is, it were not ſo fit for thee as this is, it may be therefore God chooſes it becauſe it is the moſt croſſe to thee, as ſeing it moſt ſutable for the purging out of that humour that is in thee. If a patient comes to take phiſick and finds himſelfe ſick by it, ſhall he ſay Oh! if it were any other potion I could bear it, it may be if it were any other then it is it would not fit thy diſeaſe, yea if it did not work as it doth it would not fit the diſeaſe, ſo when thou ſaieſt of an affliction, if it were any other then it is thou couldeſt bear it, doe but anſwer thy ſelfe with this, it may be if it were any other then it is it would not be fit for me. It would not hit right to that ſinfull humour that there is in my ſoul, and therefore God ſees this to be the fitteſt and the moſt ſutable for me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Know that this is the excellency of grace in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to be fitted for any condition, not only to ſay if it were this or that, but if it be any. As now a Marriner if he hath skil he would not ſay if it were any other wind but this, if the wind did blow in any point but in this, I could tell how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage my ſhip I could ſhew skil in other points but not in this, would not Marriners laugh at ſuch a one? it would be a ſhame for him to ſay that he hath skill in any other points but this: So it ſhould be a ſhame for a Chriſtian to ſay that he hath skill in any other affliction but this, a Chriſtian ſhould be able to mannage his ſhip if the wind blow any way; to guide his ſoul any way.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt anſwer is this, Know that the Lord hath
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:130622:99"/>
rewards and crowns for all graces, and for the honouring them in all conditions. It may be in ſuch a way as thou thinkeſt thou couldeſt honour God, God hath a crown for that, and God hath another crown to ſet upon the heads of thoſe that honour him in ſuch a way as this is, yea he hath ſeverall ſorts of crowns (as I may ſo ſay) in Heaven, and thoſe crowns hee muſt put upon ſome bodies head, and therefore he exerciſes thee in variety of conditions, that ſo thou mightſt have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall rewards and crowns that God hath to reward and crown thoſe that are faithfull in ſeverall conditions.</p>

               <div n="9" type="plea">
                  <head>A Ninth Plea</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but the eondition that God hath put me in makes me to be unſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable and this troubles me, it's true, if it were only an affliction and trouble to my ſelfe it were not ſo much, but I am put into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this affliction as I am unſerviceable, and am like to do God no further ſervice, God puts me into a mean eſtate, and what good can I doe? and how burdenſome is my life to me becauſe I can do no ſervice for God, and this is greiveous to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed if it be true that this is thy great greife, it is a good ſigne. If thou canſt ſay as in the preſence of God, above all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions here in this world to be layd aſide &amp; not to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice of God, I account that the greateſt Affliction: I had rather bear any trouble in the world ſo I might doe more ſervice, then to be freed from trouble &amp; to be layd a fide and do little ſervice, canſt thou ſay ſo? It is a good ſigne of grace for a man to account afflictions to be great becauſe he can doe the Lord but little ſervice. Few men account that no affliction at all.</p>
                  <p>But yet there may be a temptation in this. To murmur at Gods diſpoſe when your calling is low and mean and you can doe little ſervice, this is many times a temptation to thoſe that are poor, thoſe that are ſervants and thoſe that are of weak parts, and are faine to work hard to provide bread for their familyes, it's many times a greiveous burden to them to think, ſuch men the Lord uſes in publick ſervice and I live in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure way, and to what purpoſe is my life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:130622:100"/>Firſt to help againſt this temptation that thou mayeſt not murmur againſt this condition, Do but conſider though thy condition be low and mean, yet thou art in the Body, thou art a member of the Body though thou beeſt but a mean mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the toe and the finger hath it's uſe in the body, though it be not the eye, though it be not the head, or the heart yet it hath it's uſe in the body. And it is an excellent expreſſion that I remember <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath about this, (ſaith he) It is better to be the meaneſt member in the body, then to be the higheſt mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber and more excellent and cut off from the body, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a little ſprig in the tree joyned to the root, then to be an arme cut off from the root. Now other men that have but common gifts in the world, that are not members of Jeſus Chriſt, indeed they ſeem to have more excellency then thoſe that are godly, that are in a mean condition, mean parts, mean callings, but they are not of the body, they are not joyn'd to he root, and therefore their condition is worſe. As a great arme of a tree when it is cut off it hath a great many leaves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and it ſeems a great deal more glorious then thoſe little ſprigs that are upon the tree, but that little ſprig is in a better condition, why? Becauſe joyned to the tree and hath ſap from the root and flouriſheth, but the other will wither and die within a while: So it is with all the men of the world, they be but like great boughs cut off from the tree, though they have excellent parts, and have great eſtates and pomp and glory in the world, they have no union with Jeſus Chriſt the root; But now others that live in a poor condition, a poor trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a poor ſervant, a poor labouring-man that labours for his family every day, yet he being godly, (ſaith he) though I have but little for the preſent, little glory, little credit, little comfort yet I am joyned to the Body, and there I have ſupply and that that will feed me with comfort bleſſing and mercy to all eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So all that are in a poor condition in this world if they be godly, do but think of that; though thou beeſt mean yet thou art in the Body, and joyned to the root, thou art joyned to the principle of comfort, good, bleſſing, and mercy that will hold out to eternity, when thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of glorious pompious men in the world ſhall wither and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:130622:100"/>
periſh everlaſtingly, and therefore be not troubled at thy mean condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though thou haſt but a mean calling in this world, and ſo art not regarded as a man of uſe in the world, yet if thou beeſt a Chriſtian God hath called thee to a higher calling, thy generall calling it is a high calling, though thy particular calling be but low and mean: And for that you have a place in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before my text, <hi>Phil. 3. 14. I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So that every Chriſtian hath a high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, God hath called him to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing that he hath call'd any creature to that he hath made, the Angels in Heaven have not a higher calling then thou haſt. Thou that perhaps ſpendeſt thy time in a poor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, in the meaneſt calling, if thou beeſt a dung-raker, to rake channels, or to cleanſe places of filth or any other thing in the world that is the meaneſt that can be conceived of, thy generall calling as a Chriſtian doth advance thee higher than any particular calling can advance any man in the world; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers indeed that are call'd to mannage the Affairs of the State, they are in a high calling, or Miniſters they are in a high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but thine in ſome reſpect is higher. A poor ſervant that muſt be ſcraping all day about poor mean things many times may have ſuch a temptation as this is, Oh what a poor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath God diſpoſed me to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will God have regard to ſuch a one that is in ſuch a poor low place as I am? Oh yes, Chriſt hath regard to the meaneſt member, as a man hath as true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the toe if it be in paine, and will tender that as truly and verily as any other member; ſo Chriſt hath regard to his loweſt and meaneſt ones.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou art in a high calling, though thy outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling below in reſpect of men, yet in reſpect of God thou art in the ſame calling with the Angels in Heaven, &amp; in ſome degree cal'd to that that is higher, for the Scripture ſaith that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come to underſtand the myſtery of the Goſpel by the Church; thou that art a Chriſtian in that generall calling of thine, thou art joyned with Principalities and Powers, and with Angels, in the greateſt work that God hath called a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

creature to, and therefore let that comfort thee in this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thy calling is low and mean, yet be not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that, for thou haſt a principle within thee (if thou beeſt a godly man or woman) of Grace that doth raiſe thy loweſt actions to be higher in Gods eſteem, then all the brave glorious actions that are done in the world; the principle of faith doth it, for any man or woman to goe on in obedience to God in a way of faith in the calling that God hath ſet them, (I ſay doing this through a principle of faith) it doth raiſe this action, and make it a more glorious action then all the glorious victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then all their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and glorious pomp that they had in all their conqueſts; it was not ſo glorious as for thee to doe the loweſt action out of faith. For as <hi>I uther</hi> ſpeaks of a poor Milk-maid, and yet being a Beleever, and doth it in faith, he compares that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the glorious actions of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and makes that a great deal more eminent and glorious in the eyes of God, therefore faith raiſes thy works that are but mean, raiſes them to be very glorious.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and the truth is, there is more obedience to ſubmit to God in a low calling, then to ſubmit to him in a higher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for it's ſheer obedience, meer obedience that makes thee goe on in a low calling, but there may be much ſelfe-love that makes men goe on in a higher calling, for there's riches, credit and account in the world, and rewards comes in by that, which doth not in the other, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> goe on quietly in a low calling is more obedience to God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, know further in the laſt place, there is like to be more reward: For the Lord when he comes to reward, he doth not come to examine what the work hath been that men and women have been exerciſed in, but what their faithfulneſſe hath been, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant</hi> ſaith the Lord, he doth not ſay well done good ſervant for thou haſt bin faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me in publick works, ruling Cities and States, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Kingdoms, and therefore thou ſhalt be rewarded, no but <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant,</hi> now thou mayeſt be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in little as well as others are in more, by going on and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy dayes labour, when thou getteſt but a couple of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:130622:101"/>
to maintain thy family, thou mayeſt be as faithfull in this as thoſe are that rules a Kingdom, now God looks to a mans faithfulneſſe, and thou mayeſt have as great a reward for thy faithfulneſſe that art a poor ſervant in the Kitchin all the day, as another that ſits upon the Throne all day, and as great a Crown of glory thou mayeſt have at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a King that ſits upon the Throne, that hath ruled for God upon his Throne; yea, thy faithfulneſſe may be rewarded by God with as great glory, as a King that hath ſwaid his Scepter for God; becauſe I ſay the Lord doth not ſo much look at the work that is done, as at the faithfulneſſe of our hearts in doing it, then why ſhould not every one of us goe on comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and cheerfully in our low condition, for why may not I be faithfull as well as another? it's true, I cannot come to bee as rich a man and as honourable as others; but I may be as faithful as any other man, that every one of you may conclude with your ſelves: what doth let but that you that are the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and meaneſt may be as faithfull as the greateſt, yea you may have as glorious a crown in Heaven, and therefore go on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and chearfully in your way.</p>

                  <p>There's another reaſoning that ſome may have and that is this. <hi>Oh I could bear much affliction in ſome other way but this is very greivious to me, the unſetledneſse of my condition, though my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were but low yet if it were in a ſetled way I could be content, but it is ſo unconſtant, and ſo unſetled, that I can never know what to truſt to, but am toſt up and down in the world in an unſetled conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is hard to be content with.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer thus, that perhaps God ſees it is better for thee to live in a continual dependance upon him, &amp; not to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:130622:102"/>
know what thy conditiou ſhal be on the morrow, then for thee to have a more ſetled condition in reſpect of the comforts of the creature, do but remember that we ſpake of before, that Chriſt doth not teach you to pray Lord give mee enough that will ſerve me for two or three years, but <hi>this day our daly bread,</hi> to teach us we muſt live upon God in a dependent condition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day for dayly bread. Here was the difference that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable between the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> that depended upon God for the watering of it with ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers from Heaven, but <hi>Egypt</hi> had a conſtant way of watering the country, that did not ſo much depend upon Heaven for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but upon the river <hi>Nylus,</hi> which did at ſome certain time overflow the country: and they knowing that the watering of their country did depend upon that river and not upou Heaven they grew more proud. And therefore the Scripture to expreſſe <hi>Pharaohs</hi> pride brings him in ſaying, <hi>The river is mine,</hi> he could order the river as he pleaſed for it was his; <hi>Canaan</hi> which was a country which was to depend upon God, though they had rain at one time yet they knew not whether they ſhould have it at another time, and liv'd alwaies in a dependence upon God not knowing what ſhould become of them: Now God thought this to be a better land for his people then <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this is given as one reaſon among others for it, becauſe the Lord lookt upon this, as more ſutable to the ſtate of his people that were to live by faith, to be continually depending upon Heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe, and not to have a conſtant ſetled way in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their outward dependance; and we find it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that when thoſe that are godly live in the greateſt depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon God, and have no ſetled commings in from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they do exerciſe faith more, and are in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Souls than before.

So it is thus for all the world between God and mens ſouls, when a ſoul lives in way of meer dependence upon God, that fenſibly he ſees God hath him at advantage every moment, Oh then ſuch a ſoule will pay toll and cuſtome, that ſoul exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes faith, and begs every day his dayly bread, but if God hedges that man about with an eſtate, with proſperity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he hath an inheritance befallen him, perhaps he hath a conſtant office that brings in ſo much yeerly to him duly paid, this man is not ſo ſenſible now of his dependence upon God, he begins now to pay leſs tol and cuſtome to God than before, God hath leſſe ſervice from this man now then before. God ſees it better for his people to live in a depending condition: we are very loth in reſpect of God to be dependant, we would be all independents this way, we would be of our ſelves, and have no dependence upon the Lord, but God ſees it better for us to live in a depending condition.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:130622:103"/>
we may trifle away ſomwhat in our trading, but God takes that care ſtil we ſhal never ſpend the ſtock: As a man when his Son breaks, having ſquandered away his ſtock that he gave him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, afterwards he puts his ſtock into a friends hand, and ſaith he you ſhall keep the ſtock and it ſhall not be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo we are in a more ſetled condition in reſpect of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſtate then <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocencie; therefore let that comfort us in all our unſetled conditions in the matters of the world.</p>

                     <hi>But yet ther's another reaſoning that many murmuring hearts think to feed their humour withall,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if I never had bin in a better condition then I could bear this affliction, if God had alwayes kept me in ſo low a condition I could be content, Oh but there was a time that I proſpered more, and I had things at more full hand, and therefore now it is harder to me to be brought low, as in theſe times, perhaps a man that had five or ſix hundred a year, but now hath had nothing for a great wile, if that man had not bin borne to ſo much, or never had proſpered in any higher degree then now he is in, this affliction had bin leſs, perhaps he hath ſome monie and frinds to live upon, but if he had never bin in a higher condition he would not haue accounted it ſo great a matter to have bin without it now. This many times is our greateſt wound that once we were in a better condition; and this is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing for us to murmur upon this ground of any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, Is thy eye evill becauſe God hath bin good to thee heretofore? it's an ill thing for us to have our eye evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is good to others, but to look upon our condition with an evill eye now, becauſe God was once good to us, hath God done thee any wrong becauſe he was formerly more good to thee then he was to others?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou didſt heretofore more proſper, did God heretofore give thee more proſperity? it was to prepare thee for afflictions, we ſhould look at all our outward proſperity as a preparation to afflictions, if thou hadſt done ſo then it would not have bin ſo difficult for thee to have indured afflictions now when thou hadſt a great eſtate, yet if thou hadſt made uſe of this mercy of God to prepare thee for thy afflicted eſtate, then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:130622:103"/>
the change of thy eſtate would not be ſo greivious. That every Chriſtian ſhould do: have I an eſtate now? I ſhould prepare for poverty, have I health now? I ſhould prepare for ſickneſſe, have I liberty? let me prepare my ſelf for impriſonment? what know I what God may call me to? have I comfort and peace now in my conſcience, doth God ſhine upon me? while I have this let me prepare for Gods withdrawing from me, am I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from temptations? let me prepare now for the time of temptations, If thou wouldſt do ſo, the change of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not be ſo greivious to thee: Marriners that are in a calme will prepare for ſtormes, would they ſay if we never had calmes we could bear ſtorms, but now we have had calmes ſo many years or weeks together, this is greivious. In thy calme thou art to prepare for ſtormes, and the ſtorme would be leſſe, thou ſhouldeſt reaſon quite contrary and ſay: Now I am in an afflicted condition, Oh but bleſſed be God <hi>I was in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition,</hi> and bleſſed be God that he was a forehand with me in the waies of his mercy, this one conſideration may help murmuring hearts. Doſt thou murmur becauſe once thou wert better; know God was before hand with thee in the waies of mercy, thou ſhouldeſt rather think thus, I have lived for theſe many years, (forty years perhaps or more) in a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition, I have liv'd in health, and peace, and plenty what though the remaining part of my time have ſome ſorrow and affliction? The Lord hath granted to me a comfortable ſunſhine all the day long till towards evening, and what if at ſeven or eight a clock at night it begins to rain? let me thank God I have had ſo fair weather all day. You that are going a voyage, if you have a comfortable wind, and very fair for many months together, what if you have a little ſtorme when you are within ſight of land, will you murmur and repine? Oh no, but rather bleſſe God that you have had ſuch a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyage ſo long: Oh this conſideration would help us all; If it were ſo that now God ſhould ſay, well, you ſhal never ſee comfortable day more for outward things in this world, Oh then you have cauſe to fall down and bleſſe Gods name that you have had ſo many comfortable dayes: Now you reaſon quite contrary, whereas you ſhould bleſſe God that you have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:130622:104"/>
had ſo much comfort, you make what you have had before to be an agravation of your afflictions now, and ſo murmur and are diſcontented. That which God gave you before upon what termes did you hold it? did you hold it ſo as you have in your writings, <hi>To have and to hold for ever,</hi> God gives no ſuch thing, God gives to no man (I ſay) any thing but grace to run upon that tenour, there's no ſuch thing in all Gods writings for any outward comforts, <hi>To have and to hold for you and your heyrs,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for grace be doth give it to your ſelves, <hi>to have and to hold for ever,</hi> though not for every one that comes out of your loines to have and to hold for ever; God doth not give any outward thing ſo upon no ſuch tenour as that is, if God gives me an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of himſelf, and faith, and humility, and love, and patience, and ſuch graces of his Spirit he gives them me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, If he gives me himſelf and his Chriſt, and his promiſe, &amp; his covenant he gives me them for ever, what am I therefore that the Sun ſhould alwaies ſhine upon me, that I muſt have fair weather all my daies? that which God gives to me he gave it to me as a pledge of his love, let me returne it to him as a pledge of my obedience, there's all the reaſon in the world for it, all that a godly man receives from God he receives it as a pledge of Gods love to him, therefore when he comes into an afflicted condition (ſaith God,) returne to me as a pledge of your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that that you had from me as a pledge of my love; wee ſhould chearfully come in to God and bleſſe God that we have any thing to render unto him as a pledge of our obedience and ſay, Oh it is thy love O Lord that hath given us any thing, that doth inable us to render a pledge of our obedience to thee. When God calls for thy eſtate or any comforts that thou haſt, God calls for it as a pledge of thy obedience to him.</p>

                  <p>Another reaſoning of a murmuring heart is this. <hi>Oh but after I have taken a great deale of pains for ſuch a comfort, yet then I am eroſt in it, after a great deal of labour and pains that I have taken now to be croſt, Oh this goes very hard.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, when thou dideſt take a great deal of paine was it not with ſubmiſſion to God? Dideſt thou take pains with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that thou muſt have ſuch a thing when thou laboureſt for it? Then know that thou laboureſt not as a Chriſtian, but if thou dideſt labour and take pains was it not with reſignation to God, Lord I am taking pains in the way of my calling, but with ſubmiſſion, I depend wholy upon thee for-ſucceſſe and a bleſſing; And what was it that thou dideſt aime at in thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? was it not that thou mighteſt walke with God in the place that God had ſet thee? A Chriſtian ſhould doe ſo in his outward calling, I am diligent in my outward calling but it is that I might obey God in it; it's true, I doe it that I might provide for my family, but the cheif thing that I aime at is that I might yeeld obedience to God in the way that God hath ſet me: Now if God calls thee to another condition to obey him in though it be by ſuffring, thou wilt doe it if thy heart be right.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there will be the more teſtimony of thy love to God, if ſo be thou ſhalt now yeild up thy ſelfe to God in that that coſt thee dear, ſhall I offer that to God (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) that coſt me nothing? thy outward comforts hath coſt thee much, and thou haſt taken much pains to obtain them and now if thou canſt ſubmit to God in the want of them, I ſay in this thy love is the more ſhowne that thou canſt offer that to God that coſt thee dear.

But above all ſet Chriſt before us, that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the birds of the ayr had neſts, and the Foxes had holes, yet the Son of man had no place to hide his head in, that low condition he was in, the conſideration of ſuch things as theſe are very uſefull. It is likewiſe uſefull for men and women of eſtates to goe to poor peoples houſes and ſee how they live, to go to Hoſpitals, and to ſee the wounds of ſouldiers and others, and to ſee the lamentable condition that people live in that live in ſome Almſ-houſes, and what poor fare they have, and what ſtraights they are put to, you hear ſometimes of them, but if you went to ſee them it would not only ſtir up charity in your ſelves towards them, but ſtir up thankfulneſſe in your hearts towards God, it would be a ſpeciall means to help you againſt any diſcontent, you would goe away and ſee cauſe to bleſſe God, and ſay, if I were in ſuch a condition as they are in what ſhould I doe? how could I bear it? and yet what reaſon is there that God doth ſo order and diſpoſe of things that they ſhould be ſo low in their eſtates and I ſo high: I know no reaſon but free grace, God wil have mercy upon whom he wil have mercy: Theſe are ſome good conſiderations for the furtherance of Contentment.</p>

                  <p>Yea laſtly, conſider all the experience that you have had of Gods doing good unto you in the want of many comforts. When God croſſes you, have you never had experience of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good in afflictions? it's true when a Miniſter only tels men that God will work good out of their afflictions, they hear them ſpeak, and think they ſpeak like good men, but they feel little or no good, they feel nothing but pain, but when we cannot only ſay to you that God hath ſaid he will
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:130622:109"/>
work good out of your afflictions, but we can ſay to you, that you your ſelves have found it ſo by experience, that God hath made former afflictions to be great benefits to you, and that you would not have bin without them, or without the good that came by them for a world; ſuch experiences wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly quiet the heart and work it to content, therefore think thus with thy ſelfe, Lord why may not this affliction work as great a good upon me as afflictions have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Perhaps you may find many other conſiderations beſides in your own meditations, theſe are the principal ones that I have thought upon: Ile onely add one word more to this, of one that once was a great merchant, and tradeſ-man and it happen'd on a time that he ſuffered ſhip-wrack, and ſaith he I never made a better voyage and ſail'd better then at that time that I ſuffered ſhip-wrack, this was a ſtrange ſpeech (his name was <hi>Zeno</hi>) that he ſhould never make a better voyage, it would be a ſtrange parradox to you that are marriners, to ſay that that's a good voyage when you ſuffer ſhip-wrack, but he ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he got ſo much good by it, God was pleaſed to bleſſe it ſo far to him that he gained ſo much unto his ſoule by it, ſo much ſoul-riches that he made account it was the beſt voyage that ever he had and truly ſometimes it is ſo, yea to you that are godly I make no queſtion but you find it ſo that your worſt voyages have proved your beſt, when you have met with the greateſt croſſes in a voyage, God hath bin pleaſed to turne them to a greater good to you in ſome other way. It is true we may deſire croſſes that they may be turned to other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; but when God in his providence doth ſo order things, that you meet with ill voyages, you may expect that God will turn them to a greater good, and thoſe that have bin exerciſed in the waies of godlineſſe any long time, I make no queſtion but they have abundance of experiences that they have gain'd by them: You know ſomtimes it's better to be in a little ſhip, for they have advantage of greater ones in ſtormes many times, in a ſtorme a little ſhip can thruſt into a ſhallow place and ſo be ſafe, but your great ſhips cannot, they muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be abroad and toſt up and down in the ſtorme and tempeſt, and ſo many times ſplit againſt the rocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo it may be God ſees there is a

ſtorme a coming, and if thou beeſt in thy great ſhip thou mayſt be ſplit upon rocks and ſands, God therefore doth put thee into a leſſer veſſell that thou mayeſt be more ſafe. We will lay aſide the ſpeaking of thoſe conſiderations now, but I would not have you lay them aſide and put them out of your thoughts, but labour (thoſe eſpecially that moſt concerne you) to make uſe of them in the needful time, when you find any diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe of ſpirit to ariſe in you.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing that I intended for this exerciſe, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding directions what to do for the helping of our hearts to Contentment. For as for any further conſiderations wee have prevented the ſpeaking largely of them, becauſe we have opened the moſt things in ſhewing what the leſſons are that Chriſt teaches men, when he brings them into his School, to teach them this Art. I ſay there we have ſpoken of the ſpeciall things that are moſt conſiderable for the helping of us to this grace of Contentment. Therefore now all that I ſhall further doe about this point, ſhall be the giving of ſome directions what courſe to take that we may come to attaine this grace of Contentment.</p>

               <div n="1" type="direction">
                  <head>The firſt Direction.</head>
                  <p>The firſt is this, All the rule and helps in the world will do us little good except we get a good temper within in our hearts; you can never make a ſhip go ſteady with propping of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, you know there muſt be ballaſt within the ſhip, that muſt make it go ſteady: And ſo there is nothing without us that can keep our hearts in a ſteady conſtant way but that that is within us, grace is within the ſoul and that will do it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If you would get a contented life do not gripe too much of the world, do not take in more of the buſineſſe of the world then God calls you to, be not greedy of taking in a great deale of the world, for if a man will go among thorns when he may go in a plainer way, there is no reaſon that this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:130622:110"/>
man ſhould complaine that he is prickt with them; thou goeſt among thorns, is it thy way? muſt you of neceſſity go among them? then it's another matter, but if thou wilt electively choſe that way when thou mayeſt go another, then thou haſt no cauſe to complaine; ſo for men and women that will put themſelves upon things of the world that they need not, then no mervail though they be prickt, and meet with that that doth diſquiet them; for ſuch is the nature of all things here in the world, that every thing hath ſome prick or other in it, we are like to meet with diſappointments, and diſcontentments in every thing we meddle with, and therefore thoſe that have leaſt to do in the world, (that is, except God calls them to it, we muſt put in that) they are like to meet with many things that will diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them.</p>

                  <head>The third Direction.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, be ſure of thy call to every buſineſſe thou goeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, though it be in the leaſt buſineſſe be ſure of thy call to it, then whatever thou meetſt withall thou mayeſt quiet thy heart with this, I know I am where God would have me, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world will quiet the heart ſo much as this; when I meet with any croſs I know I am where God would have me, in my place and calling, I am about the work that God hath ſet me, Oh this will quiet and content thee when thou meeteſt with trouble: that that God calls a man to with that he may have comfort in whatſoever befalls him, God is to look to thee, and to ſee thee bleſt if thou beeſt in the work God calls thee to.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:130622:110"/>
the rule of the word in it, then let come what will come God he is to take care of me there. It was a ſpeech of a Heathen (ſaith he) if thou wilt ſubject all things to thy ſelfe, do thou ſubject thy ſelfe to reaſon and by that thou wilt make all things to be under thee; I may adde a little more to it, if you will ſubject all things under you, ſubject your ſelfe to God, and then the truth is all things are under you; It hath bin that that many times we have hinted, the reaſon why many of our Gentry have bin ſo malignant among us is, becauſe they are willing to be ſlaves themſelves under ſome above them at Court, ſo they may keep their neighbours under to be ſlaves to them, for you know any man heretofore that was great at the Court, he could cruſh any country man that he was angry withall. If there were an Arbitrary-government, then all thoſe that would be willing to be vaſſals and ſlaves to the Prince, they can make all others vaſſals and ſlaves under them. Now be thou willing to be a vaſſall to God, to be abſolutly under Gods command, and then I ſay all things in the world are under thee, <hi>All are yours</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Life and death,</hi> every thing is yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods: All things in the world are ſerviceable to that man or woman that is ſerviceable to God. It is a mighty commendations of Gods ſervice, be thou willing to be ſerviceable to God and God makes all things in the world to be thy ſervants, for ſo they are. You will ſay how are they my ſervants, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them? They are ſervants in this, that God doth order them all to work for thy good, there's nothing in the world but (faith God) it ſhall work for thy good, and be ſerviceable to thee, if thou wilt be ſerviceable to me; who would not be now Gods ſervant? Subject thy ſelfe to God, and all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now ſo long as we keep within our bounds we are under protection, but if once we break our bounds we muſt expect it ſhould be with us as it is with the deer in the Parke; while the deer keeps within the pale, there is no dogs come upon them, but they can feed quietly, but let the deere be got without the pale, and then every dog in the country will be hunting after them; ſo it is with men, let men and women keep within the bounds of the command of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:130622:111"/>
God, of the rule that God hath ſet them in his word, and then they are protected by God, and they may go about their buſineſſe with peace and never be troubled for any thing, but caſt all their care upon God, God provides for them, but if they wil go beyond the pale, if they wil paſſe their bounds then they may expect to meet with troubles, and afflictions, and diſcontent; and therefore that is a fourth direction. Walk by rule.</p>

                  <p>A fift rule is this, <hi>Exerciſe much faith, that is the way for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe.</hi> After thou haſt done with all conſiderations that reaſon may ſuggeſt to thee, if thou findeſt that theſe do not do it, Oh then call for the grace of faith, a man may go very far with the uſe of reaſon alone to help him to contentment, but when reaſon is at a non-plus then ſet faith a work. It was a ſpeech of the reverend Divine maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> that God made ſo inſtrumentall in his time, the life of faith (ſaith he) it is a true life indeed, the only life. Exerciſe faith not only in that promiſe that all ſhall work together for good to them that fear God, but likewiſe exerciſe faith in God himſelfe, as well as in his word, in the Attributes of God. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Socrates</hi> a Heathen, (ſaith he) ſince God is ſo carefull for you what need you be carefull for any thing your ſelves? It was a ſtrange ſpeech of a Heathen.</p>
                  <p>Oh Chriſtian if thou haſt any faith, in the time of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty think thus, this is the time that God calls for the exerciſe of faith, what can'ſt thou do with thy faith if thou canſt not quiet thy heart in diſcontent. It was the ſpeech of one <hi>Theodoſius</hi> that had bin a King, and afterwards was brought to ſuch a low condition to get his living by being a School-maſter; one comes and askes him, what have you got by your Philoſophy from <hi>Plato</hi> and others? what have I got (ſaith he) I have got this that though my condition be changed from ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to low, yet I have got this, I can be content. So what doeſt thou get by being a Beleever, a Chriſtian? what canſt thou do by thy faith? I can do this, I can in all eſtates caſt my care upon God, caſt my burden upon God, I can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit my way
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:130622:111"/>
to God in peace, faith can do this. Therefore when reaſon can go no higher, let faith get upon the ſhoulders of reaſon and ſay, I ſee land though reaſon cannot ſee it, I ſee good that will come out of all this evill.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe faith in thy often reſignation of thy ſelfe to God, in giving of thy ſelfe up to God and his waies, the more thou doſt in a beleeving way ſurrender up thy ſelfe to God, the more quiet and peace wilt thou have; that's the ſift thing.</p>

                     <hi>Let not men and women pore too much upon their Afflictions,</hi> that is, buſie their thoughts too much to look down into their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, you ſhall have many people that all their thoughts are taken up about what their croſſes and afflictions are, they are altogether thinking and ſpeaking of them, it's juſt with them as with a child that hath a ſore about him, his finger is

alwaies upon the ſore, and ſo men and women their thoughts are alwaies upon their afflictions, when they awake in the night their thoughts are upon their afflictions, and when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with othets (nay it may be when they are praying to God) they are thinking of their afflictions. Oh no mervail though you live a diſcontented life, if your thoughts be alwaies poring upon ſuch things, you ſhould rather labour to have your thoughts upon thoſe things that may comfort you: You ſhall have many that if you propound any rule to them to doe them good, they take it well while they are with you, and thank you for it, but when they are gone they ſoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forget it. It is very obſervable of <hi>Jacob</hi> that when his wife died in child birth, his wife called the child <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> that is, a ſon of ſorrows, now <hi>Jacob,</hi> he thought with himſelf, if I ſhould call this child <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni,</hi> every time that I name him it will put me in minde of the death of my dear wife, and of that affliction, and that will be a continued affliction to me, therefore I will not have my child have that name; &amp; ſo the text faith that <hi>Jacob</hi> called his name <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that was the ſon of my right hand; now this is to ſhew us thus much, that when afflictions befalls us we ſhould not give way to have our thoughts continually upon them, but rather upon thoſe things that may ſtir up our thankfulneſſe to God for mercies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the ſimilitude of <hi>Baſil,</hi> a learned man, (ſaith he) It is in this caſe as men and women that have fore eyes, now it is not fit for thoſe to be alwaies looking upon the fire, or upon the beames of the Sun, no (ſaith he) one that hath fore eyes muſt get things that are ſutable to him, and ſuch objects as are fit for one that hath ſuch weak eyes, therefore they will get green colours, as that being a more eaſie colour and better for weak eyes, and they will hang green ſarſnet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes becauſe it is more ſutable to them; So weak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits it's the very ſame, a man or woman that hath a weak ſpirit, they muſt not be looking upon the fire of their afflictions, upon thoſe things that deject, that caſt them down, but they are to be looking rather upon that that may be ſutable for the healing and helping of them, they ſhould be conſidering of thoſe things rather then the other.

                  <p>I beſeech you obſerve this though you ſhould forget many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Make a good interpretation of Gods waies towards you,</hi> if there can be any good interpretation made of Gods waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, make it. Ye think it much if you have a friend that ſhould alwaies make bad interpretations of your waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, you would take that ill: If you ſhould converſe with people that you cannot ſpeak a word in their hearing but they are ready to make an il interpretation of it, and take it in an ill ſenſe, you would think their company to be very tedious to you; it is very tedious to the Spirit of God when we <hi>make</hi> ſuch ill interpretations of his waies towards us. If God deals with us otherwiſe then we would have him, if there can be any ſence worſe then other made of it we will be ſure to make it; as thus, when an affliction doth befall you, there may be many good ſenſes made of Gods works towards you, you ſhould think thus it may be God intends only to try me by this, it may be God ſaw my heart to much ſet upon the Creature, and ſo intends to ſhew me what there is in my heart, it may be that God ſaw that if my eſtate did continue I ſhould fall into ſinne, that the better my eſtate were the worſe my ſoul would be, it may be God intended only to exerciſe ſome grace, it may be God intends to prepare me for ſome great work which he hath for me, thus you ſhould reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But we on the contrary make bad interpretations of Gods thus dealing with us, and ſay God doth not mean this, ſurely the Lord means by this to manifeſt his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt me, and this is but a furtherance of further evils that he intends towards me: Juſt as they did in the wilderneſſe, God hath brought us hither to ſlay us. This is the worſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation that poſſibly you can make of Gods waies, Oh why will you make theſe worſt interpretations when there may be better? In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. when the Scripture ſpeaks of love (ſaith the text) <hi>Love thinketh no evill.</hi> Love is of that nature that if there may be ten interpretations made of a thing if nine of them be naught and one good, Love will take that which is good
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:130622:114"/>
and leave the other nine; and ſo though there might be ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations preſented to thee concerning Gods waies towards thee, and if but one be good and nine naught, thou ſhouldeſt take that one that is good and leave the other nine. I beſeech you conſider God doth not deale by you as you deal with him, ſhould God make the worſt interpretation of all your waies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as you do of his towards you it would be very ill with you, God is pleaſed to manifeſt his love thus to us, to make the beſt interpretations of what we do, and therefore it is, that God doth put a ſenſe upon the actions of his people that one would think could hardly be, as thus, God is pleaſed to cal thoſe perfect that have but any uprightneſſe of heart in them, he accounteth them perfect, <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> uprightneſſe in Gods ſenſe is perfection. Now alas when we look into our own hearts we can ſcarce ſee any good at all there, and yet God is pleaſed to make ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as to ſay it is perfect: When we look into our owne hearts we can ſee nothing but uncleaneſſe, God he calls you his Saints, he calls the meaneſt Chriſtian that hath the leaſt grace under the greateſt corruption his Saint; you ſay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Saints here, but yet in Gods eſteme wee are Saints: You know the uſuall title the holy-Ghoſt gives (in ſeveral of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtls) to thoſe that had any grace, any uprightneſſe, is, <hi>To the Saints</hi> in ſuch a place, you ſee what an interpretation God puts upon them, they are Saints to him, and ſo I might name in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other particulars, God makes the beſt interpretation of things, if there be abundance of evill and a little good, God rather paſſes by the evil &amp; takes notice of the good: That ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have made uſe of, which is a very obſervable place in <hi>Peter,</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah, Sarah</hi> had a ſpeech to her husband in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 18. 12. ſhe called her husband lord, but there was but that one good word in an ill ſpeech, it was an unbelieving ſpeech, but yet when the Apoſtle mentions that ſpeech in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. the holy-Ghoſt leaves all the ill, and commends her for calling her husband lord, for putting a reverent title upon her husband; thus how graciouſly doth God deale with us? If there be but one good word among a great many ill, what an interpretation God makes! ſo ſhould we do, if there be but any
<pb facs="tcp:130622:114"/>
one good interpretation that we can make of a thing we ſhould rather make uſe of the good one then of the ill; Oh my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (I would I could now ſpeak only to ſuch as are godly) retain good thoughts of God, take heed of judging God to be a hard maſter, make good interpretations of his waies, and that's a ſpecial means to help you to Contentment in all ones courſe.</p>

You that think your eſtates to be low and you are thereupon diſcontent, and it is a grievous affliction to you, but if all men in the world were poorer then you, then you would not be diſcontent, then you would rejoyce in your eſtates though you had not a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney more then you have: As take a man that can get but his twelve pence a day, and you will ſay this were but a poor thing to maintain a family? but ſuppoſe there were no man in the world that had more then this, yea that all other men but your ſelves had ſomewhat leſſe wages then you, then you would think your condition pretty good, you ſhould have no more then than you have now, therefore it appears by this that it's rather from the fancies of other men then what you feel that make you think your condition to be ſo grevious, for if all the men in the world lookt upon you as happy, more happy then themſelves then you would be contented; Oh let not your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe depend upon the fancies of other men. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> I remember in this very caſe, Let us not make the people in this caſe to be our lords, as we muſt not make men to be the lords of our faith, ſo not the lords of our comforts; that is, that our comfort ſhould depend more upon their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:130622:115"/>
then upon what we feele in our ſelves. It may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think you to be in an afflicted condition, yea but I thank God, for my ſelfe I do not ſo apprehend it, were it not for the diſgrace, diſeſteeme and ſlightings of other men, my condition would not be ſo bad to me as now it is, this is that that makes my condition afflictive.</p>

                     </hi> When you have them do not take too much content in them, that's a certaine rule that look how inordinate any man or woman is in ſorrow when a comfort is taken from them, ſo much immoderat were they in their rejoycing in the comfort when they had it: as now for inſtance, God takes away a child and you are inordinately ſorrowful, beyond what God allows in a naturall or Chriſtian way, now though I never knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how your heart was towards the child, yet when I ſee this, (though you be a meer ſtranger to me) I may without breach of charity conclude that your heart was immoderatly ſet upon your child or husband, or upon any other comfort that I ſee you greiving for when God hath taken it away; If you hear ill tydings about your eſtates, and your hearts are dejected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatly, and you are in a diſcontented way becauſe of ſuch and ſuch a croſſe, certainly your hearts were immoderatly ſet upon the world; and ſo likewiſe for your credit, if you hear others report this or that il of you, and your hearts are de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My brethren, to conclude all for this point, if I could tell you that I knew how to ſhew you a way never to be in want of any thing, I make no queſtion but then we ſhould have much flocking to ſuch a Sermon, when a man ſhould undertake to

manifeſt to people that they ſhould never be in want any more, but I have bin now preaching unto you that that comes to as much, that that countervails this, that which is in effect all one. Is it not almoſt all one never to be in want, or never to be without Contentment? that man or woman that is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contented ſpirit, truly can never be ſaid to want much, Oh the word holds forth a way full of comfort and peace to the people of God even in this world, you may live happy lives in the mid'ſt of all the ſtorms and tempeſts in the world, there is an Arke that you may come into, and no men in the world may live ſuch comfortable chearfull and contented lives as the Saints of God, Oh that we had learned this leſſon: I have bin many Sermons about this leſſon of Contentment, but I am afraid that you will be longer in learning of it then I have bin preaching of it, it is a harder thing to learn it then it is to preach or ſpeak of it.
